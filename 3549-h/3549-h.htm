1893</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Abraham Cowley</span> was the son of
Thomas Cowley, stationer, and citizen of London in the parish of
St. Michael le Querne, Cheapside.&nbsp; Thomas Cowley signed his
will on the 24th of July, 1618, and it was proved on the 11th of
the next month by his widow, Thomasine.&nbsp; He left six
children, Peter, Audrey, John, William, Katherine, and Thomas,
with a child unborn for whom the will made equal provision with
the rest.&nbsp; The seventh child, born before the end of the
same year, was named Abraham, and lived to take high place among
the English Poets.</p>
<p>The calm spirit of Cowley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essays&rdquo; was in
all his life.&nbsp; As he tells us in his Essay &ldquo;On
Myself,&rdquo; even when he was a very young boy at school,
instead of running about on holidays and playing with his
fellows, he was wont to steal from them and walk into the fields,
either alone with a book or with some one companion, if he could
find any of the same temper.&nbsp; He wrote verse when very
young, and says, &ldquo;I believe I can tell the particular
little chance that filled my head first with such chimes of verse
as have never since left ringing there; for I remember when I
began to read and to take some pleasure in it, there was wont to
lie in my mother&rsquo;s parlour (I know not by what accident,
for she herself never in her life read any book but of devotion),
but there was wont to lie Spenser&rsquo;s works.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
delight in Spenser wakened all the music in him, and in 1628, in
his tenth year, he wrote a &ldquo;Tragical Historie of Pyramus
and Thisbe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his twelfth year Cowley wrote another piece, also in
sixteen stanzas, with songs interspersed, which was placed first
in the little volume of <i>Poetical Blossoms</i>, <i>by A</i>.
<i>C.</i>, published in 1633.&nbsp; It was a little quarto of
thirty-two leaves, with a portrait of the author, taken at the
age of thirteen.&nbsp; This pamphlet, dedicated to the Dean of
Westminster, and with introductory verses by Cowley and two of
his schoolfellows, contained &ldquo;Constantia and
Philetus,&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Pyramus and Thisbe,&rdquo;
written earlier, and three pieces written later, namely, two
Elegies and &ldquo;A Dream of Elysium.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
inscription round the portrait describes Cowley as a King&rsquo;s
Scholar of Westminster School; and &ldquo;Pyramus and
Thisbe&rdquo; has a special dedication to the Head Master,
Lambert Osbalston.&nbsp; As schoolboy, Cowley tells us that he
read the Latin authors, but could not be made to learn grammar
rules by rote.&nbsp; He was a candidate at his school in 1636 for
a scholarship at Cambridge, but was not elected.&nbsp; In that
year, however, he went to Cambridge and obtained a scholarship at
Trinity.</p>
<p>Cowley carried to Cambridge and extended there his reputation
as boy poet.&nbsp; In 1636 the &ldquo;Poetical Blossoms&rdquo;
were re-issued with an appendix of sixteen more pieces under the
head of &ldquo;Sylva.&rdquo;&nbsp; A third edition of the
&ldquo;Poetical Blossoms&rdquo; was printed in 1637&mdash;the
year of Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lycidas&rdquo; and of Ben
Johnson&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Cowley had written a five-act
pastoral comedy, &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Riddle,&rdquo; while yet at
school, and this was published in 1638.&nbsp; In the same year,
1638, when Cowley&rsquo;s age was twenty, a Latin comedy of his,
&ldquo;Naufragium Joculare,&rdquo; was acted by men of his
College, and in the same year printed, with a dedication to Dr.
Comber, Dean of Carlisle, who was Master of Trinity.&nbsp; The
poet Richard Crashaw, who was about two years older than Cowley,
and, having entered Pembroke Hall in 1632, became a Fellow of
Peterhouse in 1637, sent Cowley a June present of two unripe
apricots with pleasant verses of compliment on his own early
ripeness, on his April&ndash;Autumn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take them, and me, in them acknowledging<br
/>
How much my Summer waits upon thy Spring.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowley was able afterwards to help Crashaw materially, and
wrote some lines upon his early death.</p>
<p>In 1639 Cowley took the degree of B.A.&nbsp; In 1640 he was
chosen a Minor Fellow, and in 1642 a Major Fellow, of Trinity,
and he proceeded to his M.A. in due course.&nbsp; In March, 1641,
when Prince Charles visited Cambridge, a comedy called &ldquo;The
Guardian,&rdquo; hastily written by Cowley, was acted at Trinity
College for the Prince&rsquo;s entertainment.&nbsp; Cowley is
said also to have written during three years at Cambridge the
greater part of his heroic poem on the history of David, the
&ldquo;Davideis.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the occasional poems written
at this time by Cowley was on the early and sudden death of his
most intimate friend at the University, William Hervey, to whom
he was dearer than all but his brothers and sisters, and, says
Cowley:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Even in that we did
agree,<br />
For much above myself I loved them too.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hervey and Cowley had walked daily together, and had spent
nights in joint study of philosophy and poetry.&nbsp; Hervey
&ldquo;had all the light of youth, of the fire none.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With as much zeal, devotion, piety,<br />
He always lived as other saints do die.<br />
Still with his soul severe account he kept,<br />
Weeping all debts out ere he slept;<br />
Then down in peace and innocence he lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the sun&rsquo;s laborious light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which still in water sets at night,<br />
Unsullied with the journey of the day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cowley&rsquo;s friendship with this family affected the course
of his life.&nbsp; He received many kindnesses from his
friend&rsquo;s brother John Hervey, including introduction to
Henry Jermyn, one of the most trusted friends of Queen Henrietta
Maria, the friend who was created by her wish Baron Jermyn of St.
Edmondsbury, who was addressed by Charles I. as
&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; and was created by Charles II., in April,
1660, Earl of St. Albans.&nbsp; He was described in Queen
Henrietta&rsquo;s time by a political scandal-monger, as
&ldquo;something too ugly for a lady&rsquo;s favourite, yet that
is nothing to some.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1643 Cowley was driven from
Cambridge, and went to St. John&rsquo;s College, Oxford.&nbsp; To
Oxford at the end of that year the king summoned a Parliament,
which met on the 22nd of January, 1644.&nbsp; This brought to
Oxford many peers and Royalists, who deserted the Parliament at
Westminster for the king&rsquo;s Parliament at Oxford.&nbsp; It
continued to sit until the 16th of April, by which time the king
had found even his own Parliament to be in many respects too
independent.&nbsp; In 1644 the queen, about to become a mother,
withdrew to Exeter from Oxford, against which an army was
advancing; and the parting at Oxford proved to be the last
between her and her husband.&nbsp; A daughter was born at Exeter
on the 16th of June.&nbsp; Within two weeks afterwards the
advance of an army towards Exeter caused the queen to rise from
her bed in a dangerous state of health, and, leaving her child in
good keeping, escape to Plymouth, where she reached Pendennis
Castle on the 29th of June.&nbsp; On the 2nd of July the
king&rsquo;s forces were defeated at Marston Moor.&nbsp; On the
14th of July the queen escaped from Falmouth to Brest.&nbsp;
After some rest at the baths of Bourbon, she went on to Paris,
where she was lodged in the Louvre, and well cared for.&nbsp;
Jermyn was still her treasurer, her minister, and the friend for
whose counsel she cared most.</p>
<p>It was into the service of this Lord Jermyn that Cowley had
been introduced through his friendship with the Herveys.&nbsp; He
went to Paris as Lord Jermyn&rsquo;s secretary, had charge of the
queen&rsquo;s political correspondence, ciphered and deciphered
letters between Queen Henrietta and King Charles, and was thus
employed so actively under Lord Jermyn that his work filled all
his days, and many of his nights.&nbsp; He was sent also on
journeys to Jersey, Scotland, Flanders, Holland, or wherever else
the king&rsquo;s troubles required his attendance.&nbsp; In 1647
Cowley published his volume of forty-four love poems, called
&ldquo;The Mistress.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was himself no gallant,
neither paid court to ladies, nor married.&nbsp; His love poetry
was hypothetical; and of his life at this time he says:
&ldquo;Though I was in a crowd of as good company as could be
found anywhere; though I was in business of great and honourable
trust; though I ate at the best table, and enjoyed the best
convenience for present subsistence that ought to be desired by a
man of my condition in banishment and public distresses, yet I
could not abstain from renewing my old schoolboy&rsquo;s wish in
a copy of verses to the same effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then, I now do plainly see<br
/>
This busy world and I shall ne&rsquo;er agree,&rsquo;
&amp;c.,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I never then proposed to myself any other advantage from
his Majesty&rsquo;s happy restoration, but the getting into some
moderately convenient retreat in the country, which I thought, in
that case, I might easily have compassed, as well as some others
who, with no greater probabilities or pretences, have arrived to
extraordinary fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1654 Queen Henrietta, under influence of a new confessor,
had left the Louvre, and, with the little daughter born at
Exeter, taken up her quarters in a foundation of her own, at
Chaillot, for nuns of the visitation of St. Mary.&nbsp; Lord
Jermyn having little use left for a secretary in Paris, Cowley in
1656, after twelve years&rsquo; service in France, was sent to
England that he might there live in the retirement he preferred,
and with the understanding that he would be able to send
information upon the course of home affairs.&nbsp; In England he
was presently seized by mistake for another man, and, when his
name and position were known, he was imprisoned, until a friendly
physician, Sir Charles Scarborough, undertook to be security in a
thousand pounds for his good conduct.&nbsp; In this year, 1656,
Cowley published the first folio volume of his Poems, prepared in
prison, and suggested, he said, by his finding, when he returned
to England, a book called &ldquo;The Iron Age,&rdquo; which had
been published as his, and caused him to wonder that any one
foolish enough to write such bad verses should yet be so wise as
to publish them under another man&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; Cowley
thought then that he had taken leave of verse, which needed less
troubled times for its reading, and a mind less troubled in the
writer.&nbsp; He left out of his book, he said, the pieces
written during the Civil War, including three books of the Civil
War itself, reaching as far as the first battle of Newbury.&nbsp;
These he had burnt, for, he said, &ldquo;I would have it
accounted no less unlawful to rip up old wounds than to give new
ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When the event of battle and the
unaccountable Will of God has determined the controversy, and
that we have submitted to the will of the conqueror, we must lay
down our pens as well as arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first part of
this folio contained early poems; the second part &ldquo;The
Mistress;&rdquo; the third part &ldquo;Pindaric Odes;&rdquo; and
the fourth and last his &ldquo;Davideis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In September of the following year, 1657, Cowley acted as best
man to George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, on his marriage at
Bolton Percy, to Fairfax&rsquo;s daughter; Cowley wrote also a
sonnet for the bride.&nbsp; In December he obtained, by influence
of friends, the degree of M.D. from the University of Oxford, and
retired into Kent to study botany.&nbsp; Such study caused him
then to write a Latin poem upon Plants, in six books: the first
two on Herbs, in elegiac verse; the next two on Flowers, in
various measures; and the last two on Trees, in heroic
numbers:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Plantarum</i>, <i>Libri
VI</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the death of Cromwell, Cowley returned to France, but he
came back to England in 1660, when he published an &ldquo;Ode on
His Majesty&rsquo;s Restoration and Return,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A
Discourse by way of Vision concerning the Government of Oliver
Cromwell.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was admitted, as Dr. Cowley, among the
first members of the Royal Society then founded; but he was
excluded from the favour of the king.&nbsp; He had written an
&ldquo;Ode to Brutus,&rdquo; for which, said his Majesty, it was
enough for Mr. Cowley to be forgiven.&nbsp; A noble lord replied
to Cowley&rsquo;s Ode, in praise of Brutus, with an Ode against
that Rebel.&nbsp; Cowley&rsquo;s old friend, Lord Jermyn, now
made Earl of St. Alban&rsquo;s, joined, however, with George
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, in providing for the poet all that
was required to secure to him the quiet life that he
desired.&nbsp; Provision to such end had been promised him both
by Charles I. and Charles II., in the definite form of the office
of Master of the Savoy, but the post was given by Charles II. to
a brother of one of his mistresses.</p>
<p>Cowley recast his old comedy of &ldquo;The Guardian,&rdquo;
and produced it in December, 1661, as &ldquo;Cutter of Coleman
Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was played for a week to a full audience,
though some condemned it on the supposition it was a satire upon
the king&rsquo;s party.&nbsp; Cowley certainly was too pure and
thoughtful to be a fit associate for Charles II. and many of his
friends.&nbsp; The help that came from the Earl of St. Albans and
the Duke of Buckingham, was in the form of such a lease of the
Queen&rsquo;s lands as gave the poet a sufficient income.&nbsp;
Others who had served little were enriched; but he was set at
ease, and sought no more.&nbsp; He then made his home by the
Thames, first at Barn Elms, and afterwards at Chertsey, at which
latter place he lived for about a year in the Porch House, that
yet stands.&nbsp; Cowley was living at Chertsey when a July
evening in damp meadows gave him a cold, of which he died within
a fortnight.&nbsp; That was in the year 1667, year also of the
death of Jeremy Taylor, and of the birth of Jonathan Swift.</p>
<p>Abraham Cowley is at his truest in these <span
class="smcap">Essays</span>, written during the last seven years
of his life.&nbsp; Their style is simple, and their thoughts are
pure.&nbsp; They have, for their keynote, the happiness of one
who loves true liberty in quiet possession of himself.&nbsp; When
he turns to the Latins, his translations are all from those lines
which would have dwelt most pleasantly upon a mind that to the
last held by the devout wish expressed by himself in a poem of
his early youth&mdash;(<i>A Vote</i>, in
&ldquo;Sylva&rdquo;):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Books should, not business, entertain the
light,<br />
And sleep, as undisturbed as death, the night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My house a cottage more<br />
Than palace, and should fitting be<br />
For all my use, no luxury.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My garden, painted o&rsquo;er<br />
With Nature&rsquo;s hand, not Art&rsquo;s, should pleasures
yield,<br />
Horace might envy in his Sabine field.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>OF
LIBERTY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> liberty of a people consists in
being governed by laws which they have made themselves, under
whatsoever form it be of government; the liberty of a private man
in being master of his own time and actions, as far as may
consist with the laws of God and of his country.&nbsp; Of this
latter only we are here to discourse, and to inquire what estate
of life does best suit us in the possession of it.&nbsp; This
liberty of our own actions is such a fundamental privilege of
human nature, that God Himself, notwithstanding all His infinite
power and right over us, permits us to enjoy it, and that, too,
after a forfeiture made by the rebellion of Adam.&nbsp; He takes
so much care for the entire preservation of it to us, that He
suffers neither His providence nor eternal decree to break or
infringe it.&nbsp; Now for our time, the same God, to whom we are
but tenants-at-will for the whole, requires but the seventh part
to be paid to Him at as a small quit-rent, in acknowledgment of
His title.&nbsp; It is man only that has the impudence to demand
our whole time, though he neither gave it, nor can restore it,
nor is able to pay any considerable value for the least part of
it.&nbsp; This birthright of mankind above all other creatures
some are forced by hunger to sell, like Esau, for bread and
broth; but the greatest part of men make such a bargain for the
delivery up of themselves, as Thamar did with Judah; instead of a
kid, the necessary provisions for human life, they are contented
to do it for rings and bracelets.&nbsp; The great dealers in this
world may be divided into the ambitious, the covetous, and the
voluptuous; and that all these men sell themselves to be
slaves&mdash;though to the vulgar it may seem a Stoical
paradox&mdash;will appear to the wise so plain and obvious that
they will scarce think it deserves the labour of
argumentation.&nbsp; Let us first consider the ambitious; and
those, both in their progress to greatness, and after the
attaining of it.&nbsp; There is nothing truer than what Sallust
says: &ldquo;<i>Dominationis in alios servitium suum</i>,
<i>mercedem dant</i>&rdquo;: They are content to pay so great a
price as their own servitude to purchase the domination over
others.&nbsp; The first thing they must resolve to sacrifice is
their whole time; they must never stop, nor ever turn aside
whilst they are in the race of glory; no, not like Atalanta for
golden apples; &ldquo;Neither indeed can a man stop himself, if
he would, when he is in this, career.&nbsp; <i>Fertur equis
auriga neque audit currus habenas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pray let us but consider a little what mean, servile things
men do for this imaginary food.&nbsp; We cannot fetch a greater
example of it than from the chief men of that nation which
boasted most of liberty.&nbsp; To what pitiful baseness did the
noblest Romans submit themselves for the obtaining of a
pr&aelig;torship, or the consular dignity?&nbsp; They put on the
habit of suppliants, and ran about, on foot and in dirt, through
all the tribes to beg voices; they flattered the poorest
artisans, and carried a nomenclator with them, to whisper in
their ear every man&rsquo;s name, lest they should mistake it in
their salutations; they shook the hand, and kissed the cheek of
every popular tradesman; they stood all day at every market in
the public places, to show and ingratiate themselves to the rout;
they employed all their friends to solicit for them; they kept
open tables in every street; they distributed wine, and bread,
and money, even to the vilest of the people.&nbsp; <i>En
Romanos</i>, <i>rerum Dorninos</i>!&nbsp; Behold the masters of
the world beginning from door to door.&nbsp; This particular
humble way to greatness is now out of fashion, but yet every
ambitious person is still in some sort a Roman candidate.&nbsp;
He must feast and bribe, and attend and flatter, and adore many
beasts, though not the beast with many heads.&nbsp; Catiline, who
was so proud that he could not content himself with a less power
than Sylla&rsquo;s, was yet so humble for the attaining of it, as
to make himself the most contemptible of all servants, to be a
public bawd for all the young gentlemen of Rome whose hot lusts,
and courages, and heads, he thought he might make use of.&nbsp;
And since I happen here to propose Catiline for my instance,
though there be thousand of examples for the same thing, give me
leave to transcribe the character which Cicero gives of this
noble slave, because it is a general description of all ambitious
men, and which Machiavel perhaps would say ought to be the rule
of their life and actions.&nbsp; &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; says he,
as most of you may well remember, &ldquo;had many artificial
touches and strokes that looked like the beauty of great virtues;
his intimate conversation was with the worst of men, and yet he
seemed to be an admirer and lover of the best; he was furnished
with all the nets of lust and luxury, and yet wanted not the arms
of labour and industry: neither do I believe that there was ever
any monster in nature, composed out of so many different and
disagreeing parts.&nbsp; Who more acceptable, sometimes, to the
most honourable persons? who more a favourite to the most
infamous? who, sometimes, appeared a braver champion? who, at
other times, a bolder enemy to his country? who more dissolute in
his pleasures? who more patient in his toils? who more rapacious
in robbing? who more profuse in giving?&nbsp; Above all things,
this was remarkable and admirable in him.&nbsp; The arts he had
to acquire the good opinion and kindness of all sorts of men, to
retain it with great complaisance, to communicate all things to
them, to watch and serve all the occasions of their fortune, both
with his money and his interest, and his industry, and if need
were, not by sticking at any wickedness whatsoever that might be
useful to them, to bend and turn about his own nature and laveer
with every wind, to live severely with the melancholy, merrily
with the pleasant, gravely with the aged, wantonly with the
young, desperately with the bold, and debauchedly with the
luxurious.&nbsp; With this variety and multiplicity of his
nature, as he had made a collection of friendships with all the
most wicked and reckless of all nations, so, by the artificial
simulation of some virtues, he made a shift to ensnare some
honest and eminent persons into his familiarity; neither could so
vast a design as the destruction of this empire have been
undertaken by him, if the immanity of so many vices had not been
covered and disguised by the appearances of some excellent
qualities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see, methinks, the character of an Anti-Paul, who became all
things to all men, that he might destroy all; who only wanted the
assistance of fortune to have been as great as his friend
C&aelig;sar was, a little after him.&nbsp; And the ways of
C&aelig;sar to compass the same ends&mdash;I mean till the civil
war, which was but another manner of setting his country on
fire&mdash;were not unlike these, though he used afterward his
unjust dominion with more moderation than I think the other would
have done.&nbsp; Sallust, therefore, who was well acquainted with
them both and with many such-like gentlemen of his time, says,
&ldquo;That it is the nature of ambition&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Ambitio
multos mortales falsos fieri coegit</i>, <i>etc.</i>) &ldquo;to
make men liars and cheaters; to hide the truth in their breasts,
and show, like jugglers, another thing in their mouths; to cut
all friendships and enmities to the measure of their own
interest, and to make a good countenance without the help of good
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; And can there be freedom with this perpetual
constraint?&nbsp; What is it but a kind of rack that forces men
to say what they have no mind to?&nbsp; I have wondered at the
extravagant and barbarous stratagem of Zopirus, and more at the
praises which I find of so deformed an action; who, though he was
one of the seven grandees of Persia, and the son of Megabises,
who had freed before his country from an ignoble servitude, slit
his own nose and lips, cut off his own ears, scourged and wounded
his whole body, that he might, under pretence of having been
mangled so inhumanly by Darius, be received into Babylon (then
besieged by the Persians) and get into the command of it by the
recommendation of so cruel a sufferance, and their hopes of his
endeavouring to revenge it.&nbsp; It is a great pity the
Babylonians suspected not his falsehood, that they might have cut
off his hands too, and whipped him back again.&nbsp; But the
design succeeded; he betrayed the city, and was made governor of
it.&nbsp; What brutish master ever punished his offending slave
with so little mercy as ambition did this Zopirus? and yet how
many are there in all nations who imitate him in some degree for
a less reward; who, though they endure not so much corporal pain
for a small preferment, or some honour, as they call it, yet
stick not to commit actions, by which they are more shamefully
and more lastingly stigmatised?&nbsp; But you may say,
&ldquo;Though these be the most ordinary and open ways to
greatness, yet there are narrow, thorny, and little-trodden
paths, too, through which some men find a passage by virtuous
industry.&rdquo;&nbsp; I grant, sometimes they may; but then that
industry must be such as cannot consist with liberty, though it
may with honesty.</p>
<p>Thou art careful, frugal, painful.&nbsp; We commend a servant
so, but not a friend.</p>
<p>Well, then, we must acknowledge the toil and drudgery which we
are forced to endure in this assent, but we are epicures and
lords when once we are gotten up into the high places.&nbsp; This
is but a short apprenticeship, after which we are made free of a
royal company.&nbsp; If we fall in love with any beauteous woman,
we must be content that they should be our mistresses whilst we
woo them.&nbsp; As soon as we are wedded and enjoy, &rsquo;tis we
shall be the masters.</p>
<p>I am willing to stick to this similitude in the case of
greatness: we enter into the bonds of it, like those of
matrimony; we are bewitched with the outward and painted beauty,
and take it for better or worse before we know its true nature
and interior inconveniences.&nbsp; &ldquo;A great fortune,&rdquo;
says Seneca, &ldquo;is a great servitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; But many
are of that opinion which Brutus imputes (I hope untruly) even to
that patron of liberty, his friend Cicero.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
fear,&rdquo; says he to Atticus, &ldquo;death, and banishment,
and poverty, a great deal too much.&nbsp; Cicero, I am afraid,
thinks these to be the worst of evils, and if he have but some
persons from whom he can obtain what he has a mind to, and others
who will flatter and worship him, seems to be well enough
contented with an honourable servitude, if anything, indeed,
ought to be called honourable in so base and contumelious a
condition.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was spoken as became the bravest man
who was ever born in the bravest commonwealth.&nbsp; But with us,
generally, no condition passes for servitude that is accompanied
with great riches, with honours, and with the service of many
inferiors.&nbsp; This is but a deception the sight through a
false medium; for if a groom serve a gentleman in his chamber,
that gentleman a lord, and that lord a prince, the groom, the
gentleman, and the lord are as much servants one as the
other.&nbsp; The circumstantial difference of the one getting
only his bread and wages, the second a plentiful, and the third a
superfluous estate, is no more intrinsical to this matter than
the difference between a plain, a rich and gaudy livery.&nbsp; I
do not say that he who sells his whole time and his own will for
one hundred thousand is not a wiser merchant than he who does it
for one hundred pounds; but I will swear they are both merchants,
and that he is happier than both who can live contentedly without
selling that estate to which he was born.&nbsp; But this
dependence upon superiors is but one chain of the lovers of
power, <i>Amatorem trecent&aelig; Pirithoum cohibent
caten&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; Let us begin with him by break of day,
for by that time he is besieged by two or three hundred suitors,
and the hall and anti-chambers (all the outworks) possessed by
the enemy; as soon as his chamber opens, they are ready to break
into that, or to corrupt the guards for entrance.&nbsp; This is
so essential a part of greatness, that whosoever is without it
looks like a fallen favourite, like a person disgraced, and
condemned to do what he please all the morning.&nbsp; There are
some who, rather than want this, are contented to have their
rooms filled up every day with murmuring and cursing creditors,
and to charge bravely through a body of them to get to their
coach.&nbsp; Now I would fain know which is the worst duty, that
of any one particular person who waits to speak with the great
man, or the great man&rsquo;s, who waits every day to speak with
all the company.&nbsp; <i>Aliena negotia centum Per caput et
circum saliunt latus</i>: A hundred businesses of other men (many
unjust and most impertinent) fly continually about his head and
ears, and strike him in the face like dors.&nbsp; Let us
contemplate him a little at another special scene of glory, and
that is his table.&nbsp; Here he seems to be the lord of all
Nature.&nbsp; The earth affords him her best metals for his
dishes, her best vegetables and animals for his food; the air and
sea supply him with their choicest birds and fishes; and a great
many men who look like masters attend upon him; and yet, when all
this is done, even all this is but Table
d&rsquo;H&ocirc;te.&nbsp; It is crowded with people for whom he
cares not&mdash;with many parasites, and some spies, with the
most burdensome sort of guests&mdash;the endeavourers to be
witty.</p>
<p>But everybody pays him great respect, everybody commends his
meat&mdash;that is, his money; everybody admires the exquisite
dressing and ordering of it&mdash;that is, his clerk of the
kitchen, or his cook; everybody loves his hospitality&mdash;that
is, his vanity.&nbsp; But I desire to know why the honest
innkeeper who provides a public table for his profits should be
but of a mean profession, and he who does it for his honour a
munificent prince.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll say, because one sells and
the other gives.&nbsp; Nay, both sell, though for different
things&mdash;the one for plain money, the other for I know not
what jewels, whose value is in custom and in fancy.&nbsp; If,
then, his table be made a snare (as the Scripture speaks) to his
liberty, where can he hope for freedom? there is always and
everywhere some restraint upon him.&nbsp; He is guarded with
crowds, and shackled with formalities.&nbsp; The half hat, the
whole hat, the half smile, the whole smile, the nod, the embrace,
the positive parting with a little bow, the comparative at the
middle of the room, the superlative at the door; and if the
person be <i>Pan huper sebastos</i>, there&rsquo;s a <i>Huper
superlative</i> ceremony then of conducting him to the bottom of
the stairs, or to the very gate: as if there were such rules set
to these Leviathans as are to the sea, &ldquo;Hitherto shalt thou
go, and no further.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Perditur h&aelig;c inter
misero Lux</i>.&nbsp; Thus wretchedly the precious day is
lost.</p>
<p>How many impertinent letters and visits must he receive, and
sometimes answer both too as impertinently?&nbsp; He never sets
his foot beyond his threshold, unless, like a funeral, he hath a
train to follow him, as if, like the dead corpse, he could not
stir till the bearers were all ready.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
life,&rdquo; says Horace, speaking to one of these
<i>magnificos</i>, &ldquo;is a great deal more easy and
commodious than thine, in that I can go into the market and
cheapen what I please without being wondered at; and take my
horse and ride as far as Tarentum without being
missed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is an unpleasant constraint to be always
under the sight and observation and censure of others; as there
may be vanity in it, so, methinks, there should be vexation too
of spirit.&nbsp; And I wonder how princes can endure to have two
or three hundred men stand gazing upon them whilst they are at
dinner, and taking notice of every bit they eat.&nbsp; Nothing
seems greater and more lordly than the multitude of domestic
servants, but, even this too, if weighed seriously, is a piece of
servitude; unless you will be a servant to them, as many men are,
the trouble and care of yours in the government of them all, is
much more than that of every one of them in their observation of
you.&nbsp; I take the profession of a schoolmaster to be one of
the most useful, and which ought to be of the most honourable in
a commonwealth, yet certainly all his farces and tyrannical
authority over so many boys takes away his own liberty more than
theirs.</p>
<p>I do but slightly touch upon all these particulars of the
slavery of greatness; I shake but a few of their outward chains;
their anger, hatred, jealousy, fear, envy, grief, and all the
<i>et cetera</i> of their passions, which are the secret but
constant tyrants and torturers of their life.&nbsp; I omit here,
because though they be symptoms most frequent and violent in this
disease, yet they are common too in some degree to the epidemical
disease of life itself.&nbsp; But the ambitious man, though he be
so many ways a slave (<i>O toties servus</i>!), yet he bears it
bravely and heroically; he struts and looks big upon the stage,
he thinks himself a real prince in his masking habit, and
deceives too all the foolish part of his spectators.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a slave in <i>Saturnalibus</i>.&nbsp; The covetous man
is a downright servant, a draught horse without bells or
feathers; <i>ad metalla damnatus</i>, a man condemned to work in
mines, which is the lowest and hardest condition of servitude;
and, to increase his misery, a worker there for he knows not
whom.&nbsp; He heapeth up riches and knows not who shall enjoy
them; &rsquo;tis only that he himself neither shall nor can enjoy
them.&nbsp; He is an indigent needy slave, he will hardly allow
himself clothes and board wages; <i>Unciatim vix demenso de suo
suum defraudans Genium comparsit niser</i>.&nbsp; He defrauds not
only other men, but his own genius.&nbsp; He cheats himself for
money.&nbsp; But the servile and miserable condition of this
wretch is so apparent, that I leave it, as evident to every
man&rsquo;s sight, as well as judgment.&nbsp; It seems a more
difficult work to prove that the voluptuous man too is but a
servant.&nbsp; What can be more the life of a freeman, or, as we
say ordinarily, of a gentleman, than to follow nothing but his
own pleasures?&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you who is that true
freeman and that true gentleman; not he who blindly follows all
his pleasures (the very name of follower is servile), but he who
rationally guides them, and is not hindered by outward
impediments in the conduct and enjoyment of them.&nbsp; If I want
skill or force to restrain the beast that I ride upon, though I
bought it, and call it my own, yet in the truth of the matter I
am at that time rather his man than he my horse.&nbsp; The
voluptuous men (whom we are fallen upon) may be divided, I think,
into the lustful and luxurious, who are both servants of the
belly; the other whom we spoke of before, the ambitious and the
covetous, were &kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#8048;
&theta;&eta;&rho;&#8055;&alpha;, evil wild beasts; these are
&Gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&#8051;&rho;&epsilon;&sigmaf;
&#7936;&rho;&gamma;&alpha;&#8055;, slow bellies, as our
translation renders it; but the word
&#7944;&rho;&gamma;&alpha;&#8055; (which is a fantastical word
with two directly opposite significations) will bear as well the
translation of quick or diligent bellies, and both
interpretations may be applied to these men.&nbsp; Metrodorus
said, &ldquo;That he had learnt
&#7944;&lambda;&eta;&theta;&omega;&sigmaf;
&gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&#8054;
&chi;&alpha;&rho;&#8055;&zeta;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;,
to give his belly just thanks for all his pleasures.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This by the calumniators of Epicurus his philosophy was objected
as one of the most scandalous of all their sayings, which,
according to my charitable understanding, may admit a very
virtuous sense, which is, that he thanked his own belly for that
moderation in the customary appetites of it, which can only give
a man liberty and happiness in this world.&nbsp; Let this suffice
at present to be spoken of those great trinmviri of the world;
the covetous man, who is a mean villain, like Lepidus; the
ambitious, who is a brave one, like Octavius; and the voluptuous,
who is a loose and debauched one, like Mark Antony.&nbsp;
<i>Quisnam igitur Liber</i>?&nbsp; <i>Sapiens</i>, <i>sibi qui
Imperiosus</i>.&nbsp; Not Oenomaus, who commits himself wholly to
a charioteer that may break his neck, but the man</p>
<p class="poetry">Who governs his own course with steady hand,<br
/>
Who does himself with sovereign power command;<br />
Whom neither death nor poverty does fright,<br />
Who stands not awkwardly in his own light<br />
Against the truth: who can, when pleasures knock<br />
Loud at his door, keep firm the bolt and lock.<br />
Who can, though honour at his gate should stay<br />
In all her masking clothes, send her away,<br />
And cry, Begone, I have no mind to play.</p>
<p>This I confess is a freeman; but it may be said that many
persons are so shackled by their fortune that they are hindered
from enjoyment of that manumission which they have obtained from
virtue.&nbsp; I do both understand, and in part feel the weight
of this objection.&nbsp; All I can answer to it is, &ldquo;That
we must get as much liberty as we can; we must use our utmost
endeavours, and when all that is done, be contented with the
length of that line which is allowed us.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you ask
me in what condition of life I think the most allowed, I should
pitch upon that sort of people whom King James was wont to call
the happiest of our nation, the men placed in the country by
their fortune above an high constable, and yet beneath the
trouble of a justice of the peace, in a moderate plenty, without
any just argument for the desire of increasing it by the care of
many relations, and with so much knowledge and love of piety and
philosophy (that is, of the study of God&rsquo;s laws and of his
creatures) as may afford him matter enough never to be idle
though without business, and never to be melancholy though
without sin or vanity.</p>
<p>I shall conclude this tedious discourse with a prayer of mine
in a copy of Latin verses, of which I remember no other part, and
(<i>pour faire bonne bouche</i>) with some other verses upon the
same subject.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Magne Deus</i>, <i>quod ad has vit&aelig;
brevis attinet boras</i>,<br />
<i>Da mihi</i>, <i>da Pancin Libertatemque</i>, <i>nec
ultr&agrave;</i><br />
<i>Sollicitas effundo preces</i>, <i>si quid datur
ultr&agrave;</i><br />
<i>Accipiam gratus</i>; <i>si non</i>, <i>contentus
abibo</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">For the few hours of life allotted me,<br />
Give me, great God, but Bread and Liberty,<br />
I&rsquo;ll beg no more; if more thou&rsquo;rt pleased to give,<br

I&rsquo;ll thankfully that overplus receive.<br />
If beyond this no more be freely sent,<br />
I&rsquo;ll thank for this, and go away content.</p>

<h2><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>OF
SOLITUDE.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nunquam minus solus</i>, <i>quam cum
solis</i>,&rdquo; is now become a very vulgar saying.&nbsp; Every
man and almost every boy for these seventeen hundred years has
had it in his mouth.&nbsp; But it was at first spoken by the
excellent Scipio, who was without question a most worthy, most
happy, and the greatest of all mankind.&nbsp; His meaning no
doubt was this: that he found more satisfaction to his mind, and
more improvement of it by solitude than by company; and to show
that he spoke not this loosely or out of vanity, after he had
made Rome mistress of almost the whole world, he retired himself
from it by a voluntary exile, and at a private house in the
middle of a wood near Linternum passed the remainder of his
glorious life no less gloriously.&nbsp; This house Seneca went to
see so long after with great veneration, and, among other things,
describes his bath to have been of so mean a structure, that now,
says he, the basest of the people would despise them, and cry
out, &ldquo;Poor Scipio understood not how to live.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What an authority is here for the credit of retreat! and happy
had it been for Hannibal if adversity could have taught him as
much wisdom as was learnt by Scipio from the highest
prosperities.&nbsp; This would be no wonder if it were as truly
as it is colourably and wittily said by Monsieur de Montaigne,
that ambition itself might teach us to love solitude: there is
nothing does so much hate to have companions.&nbsp; It is true,
it loves to have its elbows free, it detests to have company on
either side, but it delights above all things in a train behind,
aye, and ushers, too, before it.&nbsp; But the greater part of
men are so far from the opinion of that noble Roman, that if they
chance at any time to be without company they are like a becalmed
ship; they never move but by the wind of other men&rsquo;s
breath, and have no oars of their own to steer withal.&nbsp; It
is very fantastical and contradictory in human nature, that men
should love themselves above all the rest of the world, and yet
never endure to be with themselves.&nbsp; When they are in love
with a mistress, all other persons are importunate and burdensome
to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Tecum vivere amem</i>, <i>tecum obeam
lubens</i>,&rdquo; They would live and die with her alone.</p>

<p class="poetry">With thee for ever I in woods could rest,<br />
Where never human foot the ground has pressed;<br />
Thou from all shades the darkness canst exclude,<br />
And from a desert banish solitude.</p>
<p>And yet our dear self is so wearisome to us that we can
scarcely support its conversation for an hour together.&nbsp;
This is such an odd temper of mind as Catullus expresses towards
one of his mistresses, whom we may suppose to have been of a very
unsociable humour.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Odi et Amo</i>, <i>qua nam id faciam ratione
requiris</i>?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Nescio</i>, <i>sed fieri
sentio</i>, <i>et excrucior</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">I hate, and yet I love thee too;<br />
How can that be?&nbsp; I know not how;<br />
Only that so it is I know,<br />
And feel with torment that &rsquo;tis so.</p>
<p>It is a deplorable condition this, and drives a man sometimes
to pitiful shifts in seeking how to avoid himself.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is, that neither he who is a fop in
the world is a fit man to be alone, nor he who has set his heart
much upon the world, though he has ever so much understanding; so
that solitude can be well fitted and set right but upon a very
few persons.&nbsp; They must have enough knowledge of the world
to see the vanity of it, and enough virtue to despise all vanity;
if the mind be possessed with any lust or passions, a man had
better be in a fair than in a wood alone.&nbsp; They may, like
petty thieves, cheat us perhaps, and pick our pockets in the
midst of company, but like robbers, they use to strip and bind,
or murder us when they catch us alone.&nbsp; This is but to
retreat from men, and fall into the hands of devils.&nbsp; It is
like the punishment of parricides among the Romans, to be sewed
into a bag with an ape, a dog, and a serpent.&nbsp; The first
work, therefore, that a man must do to make himself capable of
the good of solitude is the very eradication of all lusts, for
how is it possible for a man to enjoy himself while his
affections are tied to things without himself?&nbsp; In the
second place, he must learn the art and get the habit of
thinking; for this too, no less than well speaking, depends upon
much practice; and cogitation is the thing which distinguishes
the solitude of a god from a wild beast.&nbsp; Now because the
soul of man is not by its own nature or observation furnished
with sufficient materials to work upon; it is necessary for it to
have continual resource to learning and books for fresh supplies,
so that the solitary life will grow indigent, and be ready to
starve without them; but if once we be thoroughly engaged in the
love of letters, instead of being wearied with the length of any
day, we shall only complain of the shortness of our whole
life.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>O vita</i>, <i>stulto
longa</i>, <i>sapienti brevis</i>!</p>
<p class="poetry">O life, long to the fool, short to the
wise!</p>
<p>The First Minister of State has not so much business in public
as a wise man has in private; if the one have little leisure to
be alone, the other has less leisure to be in company; the one
has but part of the affairs of one nation, the other all the
works of God and nature under his consideration.&nbsp; There is
no saying shocks me so much as that which I hear very often,
&ldquo;That a man does not know how to pass his
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would have been but ill spoken by
Methusalem in the nine hundred and sixty-ninth year of his life,
so far it is from us, who have not time enough to attain to the
utmost perfection of any part of any science, to have cause to
complain that we are forced to be idle for want of work.&nbsp;
But this you will say is work only for the learned, others are
not capable either of the employments or the divertisements that
arise from letters.&nbsp; I know they are not, and therefore
cannot much recommend solitude to a man totally illiterate.&nbsp;
But if any man be so unlearned as to want entertainment of the
little intervals of accidental solitude, which frequently occur
in almost all conditions (except the very meanest of the people,
who have business enough in the necessary provisions for life),
it is truly a great shame both to his parents and himself; for a
very small portion of any ingenious art will stop up all those
gaps of our time, either music, or painting, or designing, or
chemistry, or history, or gardening, or twenty other things, will
do it usefully and pleasantly; and if he happen to set his
affections upon poetry (which I do not advise him too
immoderately) that will overdo it; no wood will be thick enough
to hide him from the importunities of company or business, which
would abstract him from his beloved.</p>

<p class="poetry">God made not pleasures only for the rich,<br />
Nor have those men without their share too lived,<br />
Who both in life and death the world deceived.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> seems a strange sentence thus
literally translated, and looks as if it were in vindication of
the men of business (for who else can deceive the world?) whereas
it is in commendation of those who live and die so obscurely,
that the world takes no notice of them.&nbsp; This Horace calls
deceiving the world, and in another place uses the same
phrase.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Secretum iter et fallentis semita
vit&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">The secret tracks of the deceiving life.</p>
<p>It is very elegant in Latin, but our English word will hardly
bear up to that sense, and therefore Mr. Broome translates it
very well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Or from a life, led as it were by stealth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet we say in our language, a thing deceives our sight, when
it passes before us unperceived, and we may say well enough out
of the same author:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes with sleep, sometimes with wine we
strive<br />
The cares of life and troubles to deceive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is not to deceive the world, but to deceive
ourselves, as Quintilian says, <i>Vitam fallere</i>, To draw on
still, and amuse, and deceive our life, till it be advanced
insensibly to the fatal period, and fall into that pit which
Nature hath prepared for it.&nbsp; The meaning of all this is no
more than that most vulgar saying, <i>Bene qui latuit</i>,
<i>bene vixit</i>, He has lived well, who has lain well
hidden.&nbsp; Which, if it be a truth, the world, I&rsquo;ll
swear, is sufficiently deceived.&nbsp; For my part, I think it
is, and that the pleasantest condition of life, is in
<i>incognito</i>.&nbsp; What a brave privilege is it to be free
from all contentions, from all envying or being envied, from
receiving and from paying all kind of ceremonies?&nbsp; It is in
my mind a very delightful pastime, for two good and agreeable
friends to travel up and down together in places where they are
by nobody known, nor know anybody.&nbsp; It was the case of
&AElig;neas and his Achates, when they walked invisibly about the
fields and streets of Carthage, Venus herself</p>
<blockquote><p>A veil of thickened air around them cast,<br />
That none might know, or see them as they passed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The common story of Demosthenes&rsquo;s confession that he had
taken great pleasure in hearing of a Tanker-woman say as he
passed, &ldquo;This is that Demosthenes,&rdquo; is wonderful
ridiculous from so solid an orator.&nbsp; I myself have often met
with that temptation to vanity (if it were any), but am so far
from finding it any pleasure, that it only makes me run faster
from the place, till I get, as it were, out of sight shot.&nbsp;
Democritus relates, and in such a manner, as if he gloried in the
good fortune and commodity of it, that when he came to Athens,
nobody there did so much as take notice of him; and Epicurus
lived there very well, that is, lay hid many years in his
gardens, so famous since that time, with his friend Metrodorus:
after whose death, making in one of his letters a kind
commemoration of the happiness which they two had enjoyed
together, he adds at last, that he thought it no disparagement to
those great felicities of their life, that in the midst of the
most talked of and talking country in the world, they had lived
so long, not only without fame, but almost without being heard
of.&nbsp; And yet within a very few years afterward, there were
no two names of men more known or more generally
celebrated.&nbsp; If we engage into a large acquaintance and
various familiarities, we set open our gates to the invaders of
most of our time: we expose our life to a Quotidian Ague of
frigid impertinences, which would make a wise man tremble to
think of.&nbsp; Now, as for being known much by sight, and
pointed at, I cannot comprehend the honour that lies in
that.&nbsp; Whatsoever it be, every mountebank has it more than
the best doctor, and the hangman more than the Lord Chief Justice
of a city.&nbsp; Every creature has it both of nature and art if
it be any ways extraordinary.&nbsp; It was as often said,
&ldquo;This is that Bucephalus,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;This is that
Incitatus,&rdquo; when they were led prancing through the
streets, as &ldquo;This is that Alexander,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;This
is that Domitian&rdquo;; and truly for the latter, I take
Incitatus to have been a much more honourable beast than his
master, and more deserving the consulship than he the
empire.&nbsp; I love and commend a true good fame, because it is
the shadow of virtue; not that it doth any good to the body which
it accompanies, but &rsquo;tis an efficacious shadow, and like
that of St. Peter cures the diseases of others.&nbsp; The best
kind of glory, no doubt, is that which is reflected from honesty,
such as was the glory of Cato and Aristides, but it was harmful
to them both, and is seldom beneficial to any man whilst he
lives; what it is to him after his death, I cannot say, because I
love not philosophy merely notional and conjectural, and no man
who has made the experiment has been so kind as to come back to
inform us.&nbsp; Upon the whole matter, I account a person who
has a moderate mind and fortune, and lives in the conversation of
two or three agreeable friends, with little commerce in the world
besides; who is esteemed well enough by his few neighbours that
know him, and is truly irreproachable by anybody; and so after a
healthful quiet life, before the great inconveniences of old age,
goes more silently out of it than he came in (for I would not
have him so much as cry in the exit); this innocent deceiver of
the word, as Horace calls him, this Muta Persona, I take to have
been more happy in his part, than the greatest actors that fill
the stage with show and noise, nay, even than Augustus himself,
who asked with his last breath, whether he had not played his
farce very well.</p>

<h2><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>OF
AGRICULTURE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first wish of Virgil (as you
will find anon by his verses), was to be a good philosopher; the
second, a good husbandman; and God (whom he seemed to understand
better than most of the most learned heathens) dealt with him
just as he did with Solomon: because he prayed for wisdom in the
first place, he added all things else which were subordinately to
be desired.&nbsp; He made him one of the best philosophers, and
best husbandmen, and to adorn and communicate both those
faculties, the best poet.&nbsp; He made him, besides all this, a
rich man, and a man who desired to be no richer, <i>O fortunatas
nimium et bona qui sua novit</i>.&nbsp; To be a husbandman, is
but a retreat from the city; to be a philosopher, from the world;
or rather, a retreat from the world, as it is
Man&rsquo;s&mdash;into the world, as it is God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But
since Nature denies to most men the capacity or appetite, and
Fortune allows but to a very few the opportunities or
possibility, of applying themselves wholly to philosophy, the
best mixture of human affairs that we can make are the
employments of a country life.&nbsp; It is, as Columella calls
it, <i>Res sine dubitatione proxima et quasi consanguinea
sapienti&aelig;</i>, the nearest neighbour, or rather next in
kindred to Philosophy.&nbsp; Varro says the principles of it are
the same which Ennius made to be the principles of all nature;
earth, water, air, and the sun.&nbsp; It does certainly
comprehend more parts of philosophy than any one profession, art,
or science in the world besides; and, therefore, Cicero says, the
pleasures of a husbandman, <i>Mihi ad sapientis vitam proxime
videntur accedere</i>, come very nigh to those of a
philosopher.&nbsp; There is no other sort of life that affords so
many branches of praise to a panegyrist: The utility of it to a
man&rsquo;s self; the usefulness, or, rather, necessity of it to
all the rest of mankind; the innocence, the pleasure, the
antiquity, the dignity.&nbsp; The utility (I mean plainly the
lucre of it) is not so great now in our nation as arises from
merchandise and the trading of the city, from whence many of the
best estates and chief honours of the kingdom are derived; we
have no men now fetched from the plough to be made lords, as they
were in Rome to be made consuls and dictators, the reason of
which I conceive to be from an evil custom now grown as strong
among us as if it were a law, which is, that no men put their
children to be bred up apprentices in agriculture, as in other
trades, but such who are so poor, that when they come to be men
they have not wherewithal to set up in it, and so can only farm
some small parcel of ground, the rent of which devours all but
the bare subsistence of the tenant; whilst they who are
proprietors of the land are either too proud or, for want of that
kind of education, too ignorant to improve their estates, though
the means of doing it be as easy and certain in this as in any
other track of commerce.&nbsp; If there were always two or three
thousand youths, for seven or eight years bound to this
profession, that they might learn the whole art of it, and
afterwards be enabled to be masters in it, by a moderate stock, I
cannot doubt but that we should see as many aldermen&rsquo;s
estates made in the country as now we do out of all kind of
merchandising in the city.&nbsp; There are as many ways to be
rich; and, which is better, there is no possibility to be poor,
without such negligence as can neither have excuse nor pity; for
a little ground will, without question, feed a little family, and
the superfluities of life (which are now in some cases by custom
made almost necessary) must be supplied out of the superabundance
of art and industry, or contemned by as great a degree of
philosophy.&nbsp; As for the necessity of this art, it is evident
enough, since this can live without all others, and no one other
without this.&nbsp; This is like speech, without which the
society of men cannot be preserved; the others like figures and
tropes of speech which serve only to adorn it.&nbsp; Many nations
have lived, and some do still, without any art but this; not so
elegantly, I confess, but still they have; and almost all the
other arts which are here practised are beholding to them for
most of their materials.&nbsp; The innocence of this life is in
the next thing for which I commend it, and if husbandmen preserve
not that, they are much to blame, for no men are so free from the
temptations of iniquity.&nbsp; They live by what they can get by
industry from the earth, and others by what they can catch by
craft from men.&nbsp; They live upon an estate given them by
their mother, and others upon an estate cheated from their
brethren.&nbsp; They live like sheep and kine, by the allowances
of Nature, and others like wolves and foxes by the acquisitions
of rapine; and, I hope, I may affirm (without any offence to the
great) that sheep and kine are very useful, and that wolves and
foxes are pernicious creatures.&nbsp; They are, without dispute,
of all men the most quiet and least apt to be inflamed to the
disturbance of the commonwealth; their manner of life inclines
them, and interest binds them, to love peace.&nbsp; In our late
mad and miserable civil wars, all other trades, even to the
meanest, set forth whole troops, and raised up some great
commanders, who became famous and mighty for the mischiefs they
had done.&nbsp; But I do not remember the name of any one
husbandman who had so considerable a share in the twenty
years&rsquo; ruin of his country, as to deserve the curses of his
countrymen; and if great delights be joined with so much
innocence, I think it is ill done of men not to take them here
where they are so tame and ready at hand, rather than hunt for
them in courts and cities, where they are so wild and the chase
so troublesome and dangerous.</p>
<p>We are here among the vast and noble scenes of Nature; we are
there among the pitiful shifts of policy.&nbsp; We walk here in
the light and open ways of the divine bounty; we grope there in
the dark and confused labyrinths of human malice.&nbsp; Our
senses are here feasted with the clear and genuine taste of their
objects, which are all sophisticated there, and for the most part
overwhelmed with their contraries.&nbsp; Here Pleasure looks,
methinks, like a beautiful, constant, and modest wife; it is
there an impudent, fickle, and painted harlot.&nbsp; Here is
harmless and cheap plenty, there guilty and expenseful
luxury.</p>
<p>I shall only instance in one delight more, the most natural
and best natured of all others, a perpetual companion of the
husbandman: and that is, the satisfaction of looking round about
him, and seeing nothing but the effects and improvements of his
own art and diligence; to be always gathering of some fruits of
it, and at the same time to behold others ripening, and others
budding; to see all his fields and gardens covered with the
beauteous creatures of his own industry; and to see, like God,
that all his works are good.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Oreades</i>;
<i>ipsi</i><br />
<i>Agricol&aelig; tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">On his heart-strings a secret joy does
strike.</p>
<p>The antiquity of his art is certainly not to be contested by
any other.&nbsp; The three first men in the world were a
gardener, a ploughman, and a grazier; and if any man object that
the second of these was a murderer, I desire he would consider,
that as soon as he was so, he quitted our profession and turned
builder.&nbsp; It is for this reason, I suppose, that
Ecclesiasticus forbids us to hate husbandry; because, says he,
the Most High has created it.&nbsp; We were all born to this art,
and taught by nature to nourish our bodies by the same earth out
of which they were made, and to which they must return and pay at
last for their sustenance.</p>
<p>Behold the original and primitive nobility of all those great
persons who are too proud now not only to till the ground, but
almost to tread upon it.&nbsp; We may talk what we please of
lilies and lions rampant, and spread eagles in fields d&rsquo;or
or d&rsquo;argent; but if heraldry were guided by reason, a
plough in a field arable would be the most noble and ancient
arms.</p>
<p>All these considerations make me fall into the wonder and
complaint of Columella, how it should come to pass that all arts
or Sciences (for the dispute, which is an art and which is a
science, does not belong to the curiosity of us husbandmen),
metaphysic, physic, morality, mathematics, logic, rhetoric, etc.,
which are all, I grant, good and useful faculties, except only
metaphysic, which I do not know whether it be anything or no, but
even vaulting, fencing, dancing, attiring, cookery, carving, and
such like vanities, should all have public schools and masters;
and yet that we should never see or hear of any man who took upon
him the profession of teaching this so pleasant, so virtuous, so
profitable, so honourable, so necessary art.</p>
<p>A man would think, when he&rsquo;s in serious humour, that it
were but a vain, irrational, and ridiculous thing for a great
company of men and women to run up and down in a room together,
in a hundred several postures and figures, to no purpose, and
with no design; and therefore dancing was invented first, and
only practised anciently, in the ceremonies of the heathen
religion, which consisted all in mummery and madness; the latter
being the chief glory of the worship, and accounted divine
inspiration.&nbsp; This, I say, a severe man would think, though
I dare not determine so far against so customary a part now of
good breeding.&nbsp; And yet, who is there among our gentry that
does not entertain a dancing master for his children as soon as
they are able to walk?&nbsp; But did ever any father provide a
tutor for his son to instruct him betimes in the nature and
improvements of that land which he intended to leave him?&nbsp;
That is at least a superfluity, and this a defect in our manner
of education; and therefore I could wish, but cannot in these
times much hope to see it, that one college in each university
were erected, and appropriated to this study, as well as there
are to medicine and the civil law.&nbsp; There would be no need
of making a body of scholars and fellows, with certain
endowments, as in other colleges; it would suffice if, after the
manner of Halls in Oxford, there were only four professors
constituted (for it would be too much work for only one master,
or Principal, as they call him there) to teach these four parts
of it.&nbsp; First, aration, and all things relating to it.&nbsp;
Secondly, pasturage; thirdly, gardens, orchards, vineyards, and
woods; fourthly, all parts of rural economy, which would contain
the government of bees, swine, poultry, decoys, ponds, etc., and
all that which Varro calls Villaticas Pastiones, together with
the sports of the field, which ought not to be looked upon only
as pleasures, but as parts of housekeeping, and the domestical
conservation and uses of all that is brought in by industry
abroad.&nbsp; The business of these professors should not be, as
is commonly practised in other arts, only to read pompous and
superficial lectures out of Virgil&rsquo;s Georgics, Pliny,
Varro, or Columella, but to instruct their pupils in the whole
method and course of this study, which might be run through
perhaps with diligence in a year or two; and the continual
succession of scholars upon a moderate taxation for their diet,
lodging, and learning, would be a sufficient constant revenue for
maintenance of the house and the professors, who should be men
not chosen for the ostentation of critical literature, but for
solid and experimental knowledge of the things they teach such
men; so industrious and public spirited as I conceive Mr. Hartlib
to be, if the gentleman be yet alive.&nbsp; But it is needless to
speak further of my thoughts of this design, unless the present
disposition of the age allowed more probability of bringing it
into execution.&nbsp; What I have further to say of the country
life shall be borrowed from the poets, who were always the most
faithful and affectionate friends to it.&nbsp; Poetry was born

<p class="poetry">The Muses still love their own native place,<br
/>
&rsquo;T has secret charms which nothing can deface.</p>
<p>The truth is, no other place is proper for their work.&nbsp;
One might as well undertake to dance in a crowd, as to make good
verses in the midst of noise and tumult.</p>
<p class="poetry">As well might corn as verse in cities grow;<br
/>
In vain the thankless glebe we plough and sow,<br />
Against th&rsquo; unnatural soil in vain we strive,<br />
&rsquo;Tis not a ground in which these plants will thrive.</p>
<p>It will bear nothing but the nettles or thorns of satire,
which grow most naturally in the worst earth; and therefore
almost all poets, except those who were not able to eat bread
without the bounty of great men, that is, without what they could
get by flattering of them, have not only withdrawn themselves
from the vices and vanities of the grand world (<i>pariter
vitiisque jocisque altius humanis exeruere caput</i>) into the
innocent happiness of a retired life; but have commended and
adorned nothing so much by their ever-living poems.&nbsp; Hesiod
was the first or second poet in the world that remains yet extant
(if Homer, as some think, preceded him, but I rather believe they
were contemporaries), and he is the first writer, too, of the art
of husbandry.&nbsp; He has contributed, says Columella, not a
little to our profession; I suppose he means not a little honour,
for the matter of his instructions is not very important.&nbsp;
His great antiquity is visible through the gravity and simplicity
of his style.&nbsp; The most acute of all his sayings concerns
our purpose very much, and is couched in the reverend obscurity
of an oracle.&nbsp; &Pi;&lambda;&#8051;&nu;
&#7973;&mu;&iota;&sigma;&upsilon;
&pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#8057;&sigmaf;.&nbsp; The half is more than
the whole.&nbsp; The occasion of the speech is this: his brother
Perses had by corrupting some great men
(&Beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&#8134;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&Delta;&omega;&rho;&omicron;&phi;&#8049;&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;,
great bribe-eaters he calls them) gotten from him the half of his
estate.&nbsp; It is no matter, says he, they have not done me so
much prejudice as they imagine.</p>

<p class="poetry">Unhappy they to whom God has not revealed<br />
By a strong light which must their sense control,<br />
That half a great estate&rsquo;s more than the whole.<br />
Unhappy, from whom still concealed does lie<br />
Of roots and herbs the wholesome luxury.</p>
<p>This I conceive to have been honest Hesiod&rsquo;s
meaning.&nbsp; From Homer we must not expect much concerning our
affairs.&nbsp; He was blind, and could neither work in the
country nor enjoy the pleasures of it; his helpless poverty was
likeliest to be sustained in the richest places, he was to
delight the Grecians with fine tales of the wars and adventures
of their ancestors; his subject removed him from all commerce
with us, and yet, methinks, he made a shift to show his goodwill
a little.&nbsp; For though he could do us no honour in the person
of his hero Ulysses (much less of Achilles), because his whole
time was consumed in wars and voyages, yet he makes his father
Laertes a gardener all that while, and seeking his consolation
for the absence of his son in the pleasure of planting and even
dunging his own grounds.&nbsp; Yet, see, he did not contemn us
peasants; nay, so far was he from that insolence, that he always
styles Eum&aelig;us, who kept the hogs with wonderful respect,
&Delta;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;
&#8020;&phi;&upsilon;&rho;&beta;&upsilon;&nu;, the divine
swine-herd; he could have done no more for Menelaus or
Agamemnon.&nbsp; And Theocritus (a very ancient poet, but he was
one of our own tribe, for he wrote nothing but pastorals) gave
the same epithet to a husbandman
&Epsilon;&mu;&#8051;&iota;&beta;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;
&Delta;&#8150;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&#7936;&gamma;&rho;&#8061;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;.&nbsp; The divine
husbandman replied to Hercules, who was but
&Delta;&#8150;&omicron;&sigmaf; himself.&nbsp; These were civil
Greeks, and who understood the dignity of our calling.&nbsp;
Among the Romans, we have in the first place our truly divine
Virgil, who, though by the favour of M&aelig;cenas and Augustus
he might have been one of the chief men of Rome, yet chose rather
to employ much of his time in the exercise, and much of his
immortal wit in the praise and instructions of a rustic life;
who, though he had written before whole books of Pastorals and
Georgics, could not abstain in his great and imperial poem from
describing Evander, one of his best princes, as living just after
the homely manner of an ordinary countryman.&nbsp; He seats him
in a throne of maple, and lays him but upon a bear&rsquo;s skin,
the kine and oxen are lowing in his courtyard, the birds&rsquo;
under the eaves of his window call him up in the morning; and
when he goes abroad only two dogs go along, with him for his
guard.&nbsp; At last, when he brings &AElig;neas into his royal
cottage, he makes him say this memorable compliment, greater than
ever yet was spoken at the Escurial, the Louvre, or our
Whitehall.</p>
<p

<p class="poetry">This humble roof, this rustic court, said
he,<br />
Received Alcides crowned with victory.<br />
Scorn not, great guest, the steps where he has trod,<br />
But contemn wealth, and imitate a god.</p>
<p>The next man whom we are much obliged to, both for his
doctrine and example, is the next best poet in the world to
Virgil: his dear friend Horace, who, when Augustus had desired
Mec&aelig;nas to persuade him to come and live domestically and
at the same table with him, and to be Secretary of State of the
whole world under him, or rather jointly with him (for he says,
&ldquo;<i>ut nos in Epistolis scribendis adjuvet</i>,&rdquo;)
could not be tempted to forsake his Sabine or Tiburtine Manor,
for so rich and so glorious a trouble.&nbsp; There was never, I
think, such an example as this in the world, that he should have
so much moderation and courage as to refuse an offer of such
greatness, and the Emperor so much generosity and good nature as
not to be at all offended with his refusal, but to retain still
the same kindness, and express it often to him in most friendly
and familiar letters, part of which are still extant.&nbsp; If I
should produce all the passages of this excellent author upon the
several subjects which I treat of in this book, I must be obliged
to translate half his works; of which I may say more truly than,
in my opinion, he did of Homer, &ldquo;<i>Qui quid sit
pulchrum</i>, <i>quid turpe</i>, <i>quid utile</i>, <i>quid
non</i>, <i>plenius</i>, <i>et melius Chrysippo</i>, <i>et
Crantore dicit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shall content myself upon this
particular theme with three only, one out of his Odes, the other
out of his Satires, the third out of his Epistles, and shall
forbear to collect the suffrages of all other poets, which may be
found scattered up and down through all their writings, and
especially in Martial&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But I must not omit to make
some excuse for the bold undertaking of my own unskilful pencil
upon the beauties of a face that has been drawn before by so many
great masters, especially that I should dare to do it in Latin
verses (though of another kind) and have the confidence to
translate them.&nbsp; I can only say that I love the matter, and
that ought to cover, many faults; and that I run not to contend
with those before me, but follow to applaud them.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Oh</span> happy (if his
happiness he knows)<br />
The country swain, on whom kind Heaven bestows<br />
At home all riches that wise Nature needs;<br />
Whom the just earth with easy plenty feeds.<br />
&rsquo;Tis true, no morning tide of clients comes,<br />
And fills the painted channels of his rooms,<br />
Adoring the rich figures, as they pass,<br />
In tapestry wrought, or cut in living brass;<br />
Nor is his wool superfluously dyed<br />
With the dear poison of Assyrian pride:<br />
Nor do Arabian perfumes vainly spoil<br />
The native use and sweetness of his oil.<br />
Instead of these, his calm and harmless life,<br />
Free from th&rsquo; alarms of fear, and storms of strife,<br />
Does with substantial blessedness abound,<br />
And the soft wings of peace cover him round:<br />
Through artless grots the murmuring waters glide;<br />
Thick trees both against heat and cold provide,<br />
From whence the birds salute him; and his ground<br />
With lowing herds, and bleating sheep does sound;<br />
And all the rivers, and the forests nigh,<br />
Both food and game and exercise supply.<br />
Here a well-hardened, active youth we see,<br />
Taught the great art of cheerful poverty.<br />
Here, in this place alone, there still do shine<br />
Some streaks of love, both human and divine;<br />
From hence Astr&aelig;a took her flight, and here<br />
Still her last footsteps upon earth appear.<br />
&rsquo;Tis true, the first desire which does control<br />
All the inferior wheels that move my soul,<br />
Is, that the Muse me her high priest would make;<br />
Into her holiest scenes of mystery take,<br />
And open there to my mind&rsquo;s purg&egrave;d eye<br />
Those wonders which to sense the gods deny;<br />
How in the moon such chance of shapes is found<br />
The moon, the changing world&rsquo;s eternal bound.<br />
What shakes the solid earth, what strong disease<br />
Dares trouble the firm centre&rsquo;s ancient ease;<br />
What makes the sea retreat, and what advance:<br />
Varieties too regular for chance.<br />
What drives the chariot on of winter&rsquo;s light,<br />
And stops the lazy waggon of the night.<br />
But if my dull and frozen blood deny<br />
To send forth spirits that raise a soul so high;<br />
In the next place, let woods and rivers be<br />
My quiet, though unglorious, destiny.<br />
In life&rsquo;s cool vale let my low scene be laid;<br />
Cover me, gods, with Tempe&rsquo;s thickest shade<br />
Happy the man, I grant, thrice happy he<br />
Who can through gross effects their causes see:<br />
Whose courage from the deeps of knowledge springs.<br />
Nor vainly fears inevitable things;<br />
But does his walk of virtue calmly go,<br />
Through all th&rsquo; alarms of death and hell below.<br />
Happy! but next such conquerors, happy they,<br />
Whose humble life lies not in fortune&rsquo;s way.<br />
They unconcerned from their safe distant seat<br />
Behold the rods and sceptres of the great.<br />
The quarrels of the mighty, without fear,<br />
And the descent of foreign troops they hear.<br />
Nor can even Rome their steady course misguide,<br />
With all the lustre of her perishing pride.<br />
Them never yet did strife or avarice draw<br />
Into the noisy markets of the law,<br />
The camps of gown&eacute;d war, nor do they live<br />
By rules or forms that many mad men give,<br />
Duty for nature&rsquo;s bounty they repay,<br />
And her sole laws religiously obey.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some with bold labour plough the faithless main;<br
/>
Some rougher storms in princes&rsquo; courts sustain.<br />
Some swell up their slight sails with popular fame,<br />
Charmed with the foolish whistlings of a name.<br />
Some their vain wealth to earth again commit;<br />
With endless cares some brooding o&rsquo;er it sit.<br />
Country and friends are by some wretches sold,<br />
To lie on Tyrian beds and drink in gold;<br />
No price too high for profit can be shown;<br />
Not brother&rsquo;s blood, nor hazards of their own.<br />
Around the world in search of it they roam;<br />
It makes e&rsquo;en their Antipodes their home.<br />
Meanwhile, the prudent husbandman is found<br />
In mutual duties striving with his ground;<br />
And half the year he care of that does take<br />
That half the year grateful returns does make<br />
Each fertile month does some new gifts present,<br />
And with new work his industry content:<br />
This the young lamb, that the soft fleece doth yield,<br />
This loads with hay, and that with corn the field:<br />
All sorts of fruit crown the rich autumn&rsquo;s pride:<br />
And on a swelling hill&rsquo;s warm stony side,<br />
The powerful princely purple of the vine,<br />
Twice dyed with the redoubled sun, does shine.<br />
In th&rsquo; evening to a fair ensuing day,<br />
With joy he sees his flocks and kids to play,<br />
And loaded kine about his cottage stand,<br />
Inviting with known sound the milker&rsquo;s hand;<br />
And when from wholesome labour he doth come,<br />
With wishes to be there, and wished for home,<br />
He meets at door the softest human blisses,<br />
His chaste wife&rsquo;s welcome, and dear children&rsquo;s
kisses.<br />
When any rural holydays invite<br />
His genius forth to innocent delight,<br />
On earth&rsquo;s fair bed beneath some sacred shade,<br />
Amidst his equal friends carelessly laid,<br />
He sings thee, Bacchus, patron of the vine,<br />
The beechen bowl foams with a flood of wine,<br />
Not to the loss of reason or of strength.<br />
To active games and manly sport at length<br />
Their mirth ascends, and with filled veins they see,<br />
Who can the best at better trials be.<br />
Such was the life the prudent Sabine chose,<br />
From such the old Etrurian virtue rose.<br />
Such, Remus and the god his brother led,<br />
From such firm footing Rome grew the world&rsquo;s head.<br />
Such was the life that even till now does raise<br />
The honour of poor Saturn&rsquo;s golden days:<br />
Before men born of earth and buried there,<br />
Let in the sea their mortal fate to share,<br />
Before new ways of perishing were sought,<br />
Before unskilful death on anvils wrought.<br />
Before those beasts which human life sustain,<br />
By men, unless to the gods&rsquo; use, were slain.</p>

bounteous gods allow<br />
With his own hand paternal grounds to plough!<br />
Like the first golden mortals, happy he,<br />
From business and the cares of money free!<br />
No human storms break off at land his sleep,<br />
No loud alarms of nature on the deep.<br />
From all the cheats of law he lives secure,<br />
Nor does th&rsquo; affronts of palaces endure.<br />
Sometimes the beauteous marriageable vine<br />
He to the lusty bridegroom elm does join;<br />
Sometimes he lops the barren trees around,<br />
And grafts new life into the fruitful wound;<br />
Sometimes he shears his flock, and sometimes he<br />
Stores up the golden treasures of the bee.<br />
He sees his lowing herds walk o&rsquo;er the plain,<br />
Whilst neighbouring hills low back to them again.<br />

All her autumnal bounty does display,<br />
How is he pleas&rsquo;d th&rsquo; increasing use to see<br />

His head uncharged with fear or with design.<br />
By him a river constantly complains,<br />
The birds above rejoice with various strains,<br />

Sleep which does always there for entrance wait,<br />
And nought within against it shuts the gate.<br />

He runs the mazes of the nimble hare,<br />
His well-mouthed dogs&rsquo; glad concert rends the air,<br />
Or with game bolder, and rewarded more,<br />
He drives into a toil the foaming boar;<br />
Here flies the hawk to assault, and there the net<br />
To intercept the travelling fowl is set;<br />
And all his malice, all his craft is shown<br />
In innocent wars, on beasts and birds alone.<br />
This is the life from all misfortune free,<br />
From thee, the great one, tyrant love, from thee;<br />
And if a chaste and clean though homely wife,<br />
Be added to the blessings of this life,&mdash;<br />
Such as the ancient sun-burnt Sabines were,<br />
Such as Apulia, frugal still, does bear,&mdash;<br />
Who makes her children and the house her care<br />
And joyfully the work of life does share;<br />
Nor thinks herself too noble or too fine<br />
To pin the sheepfold or to milk the kine;<br />
Who waits at door against her husband come<br />
From rural duties, late, and wearied home,<br />
Where she receives him with a kind embrace,<br />
A cheerful fire, and a more cheerful face:<br />
And fills the bowl up to her homely lord,<br />
And with domestic plenty load the board.<br />
Not all the lustful shell-fish of the sea,<br />
Dressed by the wanton hand of luxury,<br />
Nor ortolans nor godwits nor the rest<br />
Of costly names that glorify a feast,<br />

<h3>THE COUNTRY MOUSE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A Paraphrase upon Horace</i>,
<span class="GutSmall">II</span> <i>Book</i>, <i>Satire</i>
vi.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">At</span> the large foot of
a fair hollow tree,<br />
Close to ploughed ground, seated commodiously,<br />
His ancient and hereditary house,<br />
There dwelt a good substantial country mouse:<br />
Frugal, and grave, and careful of the main,<br />
Yet one who once did nobly entertain<br />
A city mouse, well coated, sleek, and gay,<br />
A mouse of high degree, which lost his way,<br />
Wantonly walking forth to take the air,<br />
And arrived early, and alighted there,<br />
For a day&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp; The good hearty host<br />
(The ancient plenty of his hall to boast)<br />
Did all the stores produce that might excite,<br />
With various tastes, the courtier&rsquo;s appetite.<br />
Fitches and beans, peason, and oats, and wheat,<br />
And a large chestnut, the delicious meat<br />
Which Jove himself, were he a mouse, would eat.<br />
And for a haut goust there was mixed with these<br />
The swerd of bacon, and the coat of cheese,<br />
The precious relics, which at harvest he<br />
Had gathered from the reapers&rsquo; luxury.<br />
&ldquo;Freely,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;fall on, and never
spare,<br />
The bounteous gods will for to-morrow care.&rdquo;<br />
And thus at ease on beds of straw they lay,<br />
And to their genius sacrificed the day.<br />
Yet the nice guest&rsquo;s epicurean mind<br />
(Though breeding made him civil seem, and kind)<br />
Despised this country feast, and still his thought<br />
Upon the cakes and pies of London wrought.<br />
&ldquo;Your bounty and civility,&rdquo; said he,<br />
&ldquo;Which I&rsquo;m surprised in these rude parts to see,<br
/>
Show that the gods have given you a mind<br />
Too noble for the fate which here you find.<br />
Why should a soul, so virtuous and so great,<br />
Lose itself thus in an obscure retreat?<br />
Let savage beasts lodge in a country den,<br />
You should see towns, and manners know, and men;<br />
And taste the generous luxury of the court,<br />
Where all the mice of quality resort;<br />
Where thousand beauteous shes about you move,<br />
And by high fare are pliant made to love.<br />
We all ere long must render up our breath,<br />
No cave or hole can shelter us from death.<br />
Since life is so uncertain and so short,<br />
Let&rsquo;s spend it all in feasting and in sport.<br />
Come, worthy sir, come with me, and partake<br />
All the great things that mortals happy make.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas, what virtue hath sufficient arms<br />
To oppose bright honour and soft pleasure&rsquo;s charms?<br />
What wisdom can their magic force repel?<br />
It draws the reverend hermit from his cell.<br />
It was the time, when witty poets tell,<br />
That Phoebus into Thetis&rsquo; bosom fell:<br />
She blushed at first, and then put out the light,<br />
And drew the modest curtains of the night.<br />
Plainly the truth to tell, the sun was set,<br />
When to the town our wearied travellers get.<br />
To a lord&rsquo;s house, as lordly as can be,<br />
Made for the use of pride and luxury,<br />
They some; the gentle courtier at the door<br />
Stops, and will hardly enter in before;&mdash;<br />
But &rsquo;tis, sir, your command, and being so,<br />
I&rsquo;m sworn t&rsquo; obedience&mdash;and so in they go.<br />
Behind a hanging in a spacious room<br />
(The richest work of Mortlake&rsquo;s noble loom)<br />
They wait awhile their wearied limbs to rest,<br />
Till silence should invite them to their feast,<br />
About the hour that Cynthia&rsquo;s silver light<br />
Had touched the pale meridies of the night,<br />
At last, the various supper being done,<br />
It happened that the company was gone<br />
Into a room remote, servants and all,<br />
To please their noble fancies with a ball.<br />
Our host leads forth his stranger, and does find<br />
All fitted to the bounties of his mind.<br />
Still on the table half-filled dishes stood,<br />
And with delicious bits the floor was strewed;<br />
The courteous mouse presents him with the best,<br />
And both with fat varieties are blest.<br />
The industrious peasant everywhere does range,<br />
And thanks the gods for his life&rsquo;s happy change.<br />
Lo, in the midst of a well-freighted pie<br />
They both at last glutted and wanton lie,<br />
When see the sad reverse of prosperous fate,<br />
And what fierce storms on mortal glories wait!<br />
With hideous noise, down the rude servants come,<br />
Six dogs before run barking into th&rsquo; room;<br />
The wretched gluttons fly with wild affright,<br />
And hate the fulness which retards their flight.<br />
Our trembling peasant wishes now in vain.<br />
That rocks and mountains covered him again.<br />
Oh, how the change of his poor life, he cursed!<br />
&ldquo;This, of all lives,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is sure the
worst.<br />
Give me again, ye gods, my cave and wood;<br />
With peace, let tares and acorns be my food.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>HORACE TO FUSCUS ARISTIUS.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A Paraphrase upon the Eightieth
Epistle of the First Book of Horace</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Health</span>, from the
lover of the country, me,<br />
Health, to the lover of the city, thee,<br />
A difference in our souls, this only proves,<br />
In all things else, we agree like married doves.<br />
But the warm nest and crowded dove house thou<br />
Dost like; I loosely fly from bough to bough;<br />
And rivers drink, and all the shining day,<br />
Upon fair trees or mossy rocks I play;<br />
In fine, I live and reign when I retire<br />
From all that you equal with heaven admire.<br />
Like one at last from the priest&rsquo;s service fled,<br />
Loathing the honied cakes, I long for bread.<br />
Would I a house for happiness erect,<br />
Nature alone should be the architect.<br />
She&rsquo;d build it more convenient than great,<br />
And doubtless in the country choose her seat.<br />
Is there a place doth better helps supply<br />
Against the wounds of winter&rsquo;s cruelty?<br />
Is there an air that gentler does assuage<br />
The mad celestial dog&rsquo;s or lion&rsquo;s rage?<br />
Is it not there that sleep (and only there)<br />
Nor noise without, nor cares within does fear?<br />
Does art through pipes a purer water bring<br />
Than that which nature strains into a spring?<br />
Can all your tapestries, or your pictures, show<br />
More beauties than in herbs and flowers do grow?<br />
Fountains and trees our wearied pride do please,<br />
Even in the midst of gilded palaces.<br />
And in your towns that prospect gives delight<br />
Which opens round the country to our sight.<br />
Men to the good, from which they rashly fly,<br />
Return at last, and their wild luxury<br />
Does but in vain with those true joys contend<br />
Which nature did to mankind recommend.<br />
The man who changes gold for burnished brass,<br />
Or small right gems for larger ones of glass,<br />
Is not, at length, more certain to be made<br />
Ridiculous and wretched by the trade,<br />
Than he who sells a solid good to buy<br />
The painted goods of pride and vanity.<br />
If thou be wise, no glorious fortune choose,<br />
Which &rsquo;t is but pain to keep, yet grief to lose.<br />
For when we place even trifles in the heart,<br />
With trifles too unwillingly we part.<br />
An humble roof, plain bed, and homely board,<br />
More clear, untainted pleasures do afford<br />
Than all the tumult of vain greatness brings<br />
To kings, or to the favourites of kings.<br />
The horn&eacute;d deer, by nature armed so well,<br />
Did with the horse in common pasture dwell;<br />
And when they fought, the field it always won,<br />
Till the ambitious horse begged help of man,<br />
And took the bridle, and thenceforth did reign<br />
Bravely alone, as lord of all the plain:<br />
But never after could the rider get<br />
From off his back, or from his mouth the bit.<br />
So they, who poverty too much do fear,<br />
To avoid that weight, a greater burden bear;<br />
That they might power above their equals have,<br />
To cruel masters they themselves enslave.<br />
For gold, their liberty exchanged we see,<br />
That fairest flower which crowns humanity.<br />
And all this mischief does upon them light,<br />
Only because they know not how aright<br />
That great, but secret, happiness to prize,<br />
That&rsquo;s laid up in a little, for the wise:<br />
That is the best and easiest estate<br />
Which to a man sits close, but not too strait.<br />
&rsquo;Tis like a shoe: it pinches, and it burns,<br />
Too narrow; and too large it overturns.<br />
My dearest friend, stop thy desires at last,<br />
And cheerfully enjoy the wealth thou hast.<br />
And, if me still seeking for more you see,<br />
Chide and reproach, despise and laugh at me.<br />
Money was made, not to command our will,<br />
But all our lawful pleasures to fulfil.<br />
Shame and woe to us, if we our wealth obey;<br />

<h3>THE COUNTRY LIFE.</h3>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Blest</span> be the man
(and blest he is) whom e&rsquo;er<br />
(Placed far out of the roads of hope or fear)<br />
A little field and little garden feeds;<br />
The field gives all that frugal nature needs,<br />
The wealthy garden liberally bestows<br />
All she can ask, when she luxurious grows.<br />
The specious inconveniences, that wait<br />
Upon a life of business and of state,<br />
He sees (nor does the sight disturb his rest)<br />
By fools desired, by wicked men possessed.<br />
Thus, thus (and this deserved great Virgil&rsquo;s praise)<br />
The old Corycian yeoman passed his days,<br />
Thus his wise life Abdolonymus spent:<br />
The ambassadors which the great emperor sent<br />
To offer him a crown, with wonder found<br />
The reverend gardener hoeing of his ground;<br />
Unwillingly and slow, and discontent,<br />
From his loved cottage to a throne he went.<br />
And oft he stopped in his triumphant way,<br />
And oft looked back, and oft was heard to say,<br />
Not without sighs, &ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; I there forsake<br />
A happier kingdom than I go to take.&rdquo;<br />
Thus Agla&uuml;s (a man unknown to men,<br />
But the gods knew, and therefore loved him then)<br />
Thus lived obscurely then without a name,<br />
Agla&uuml;s, now consigned to eternal fame.<br />
For Gyges, the rich king, wicked and great,<br />
Presumed at wise Apollo&rsquo;s Delphic seat,<br />
Presumed to ask, &ldquo;O thou, the whole world&rsquo;s eye,<br
/>
Seest thou a man that happier is than I?&rdquo;<br />
The god, who scorned to flatter man, replied,<br />
&ldquo;Agla&uuml;s happier is.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Gyges cried,<br
/>
In a proud rage, &ldquo;Who can that Agla&uuml;s be?<br />
We have heard as yet of no such king as he.&rdquo;<br />
And true it was, through the whole earth around<br />
No king of such a name was to be found.<br />
&ldquo;Is some old hero of that name alive,<br />
Who his high race does from the gods derive?<br />
Is it some mighty general that has done<br />
Wonders in fight, and god-like honours won?<br />
Is it some man of endless wealth?&rdquo; said he;<br />
&ldquo;None, none of these: who can this Agla&uuml;s
be?&rdquo;<br />
After long search, and vain inquiries passed,<br />
In an obscure Arcadian vale at last<br />
(The Arcadian life has always shady been)<br />
Near Sopho&rsquo;s town (which he but once had seen)<br />
This Agla&uuml;s, who monarchs&rsquo; envy drew,<br />
Whose happiness the gods stood witness to,<br />
This mighty Agla&uuml;s was labouring found,<br />
With his own hands, in his own little ground.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, gracious God (if it may lawful be,<br />
Among those foolish gods to mention Thee),<br />
So let me act, on such a private stage,<br />
The last dull scenes of my declining age;<br />
After long toils and voyages in vain,<br />
This quiet port let my tossed vessel gain;<br />
Of heavenly rest this earnest to me lend,<br />
Let my life sleep, and learn to love her end.</p>

GARDEN</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To J</i>. <i>Evelyn</i>,
<i>Esquire</i>.</p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">never</span> had any other desire so
strong, and so like to covetousness, as that one which I have had
always, that I might be master at last of a small house and large
garden, with very moderate conveniences joined to them, and there
dedicate the remainder of my life only to the culture of them and
the study of nature.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there (with no design beyond my wall) whole
and entire to lie,<br />
In no unactive ease, and no unglorious poverty.</p>
<p>Or, as Virgil has said, shorter and better for me, that I
might there <i>studiis florere ignobilis otii</i>, though I could
wish that he had rather said <i>Nobilis otii</i> when he spoke of
his own.&nbsp; But several accidents of my ill fortune have
disappointed me hitherto, and do still, of that felicity; for
though I have made the first and hardest step to it, by
abandoning all ambitions and hopes in this world, and by retiring
from the noise of all business and almost company, yet I stick
still in the inn of a hired house and garden, among weeds and
rubbish, and without that pleasantest work of human
industry&mdash;the improvement of something which we call (not
very properly, but yet we call) our own.&nbsp; I am gone out from
Sodom, but I am not arrived at my little Zoar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
let me escape thither (is it not a little one!), and my soul
shall live.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not look back yet; but I have been
forced to stop and make too many halts.&nbsp; You may wonder, sir
(for this seems a little too extravagant and Pindarical for
prose) what I mean by all this preface.&nbsp; It is to let you
know, that though I have missed, like a chemist, my great end,
yet I account my afflictions and endeavours well rewarded by
something that I have met with by-the-by, which is, that they
have produced to me some part in your kindness and esteem; and
thereby the honour of having my name so advantageously
recommended to posterity by the epistle you are pleased to prefix
to the most useful book that has been written in that kind, and
which is to last as long as months and years.</p>
<p>Among many other arts and excellencies which you enjoy, I am
glad to find this favourite of mine the most predominant, that
you choose this for your wife, though you have hundreds of other
arts for your concubines; though you know them, and beget sons
upon them all (to which you are rich enough to allow great
legacies), yet the issue of this seems to be designed by you to
the main of the estate; you have taken most pleasure in it, and
bestowed most charges upon its education, and I doubt not to see
that book which you are pleased to promise to the world, and of
which you have given us a large earnest in your calendar, as
accomplished as anything can be expected from an extraordinary
wit and no ordinary expenses and a long experience.&nbsp; I know
nobody that possesses more private happiness than you do in your
garden, and yet no man who makes his happiness more public by a
free communication of the art and knowledge of it to
others.&nbsp; All that I myself am able yet to do is only to
recommend to mankind the search of that felicity which you
instruct them how to find and to enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">I.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy art thou whom God does
bless<br />
With the full choice of thine own happiness;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And happier yet, because thou&rsquo;rt blessed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With prudence how to choose the best.<br />
In books and gardens thou hast placed aright,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Things which thou well dost understand,<br />
And both dost make with thy laborious hand&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy noble, innocent delight,<br />
And in thy virtuous wife, where thou again dost meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both pleasures more refined and sweet:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fairest garden in her looks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in her mind the wisest books.<br />
Oh! who would change these soft, yet solid joys,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For empty shows and senseless noise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all which rank ambition breeds,<br />
Which seem such beauteous flowers, and are such poisonous
weeds!</p>

<p class="poetry">When God did man to his own likeness make,<br

As much as clay, though of the purest kind<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the Great Potter&rsquo;s art refined,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the Divine impression take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought it fit to place him where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A kind of heaven, too, did appear,<br />
As far as earth could such a likeness bear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Man no happiness might want,<br />
Which earth to her first master could afford,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He did a garden for him plant<br />
By the quick hand of his omnipotent word,<br />
As the chief help and joy of human life,<br />
He gave him the first gift; first, even, before a wife.</p>

<p class="poetry">For God, the universal architect,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;T had been as easy to erect<br />
A Louvre, or Escurial, or a tower<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted not the skill or
power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the world&rsquo;s fabric those
were shown,<br />
And the materials were all his own.<br />
But well he knew what place would best agree<br />
With innocence and with felicity;<br />
And we elsewhere still seek for them in vain.<br />

<p class="poetry">Oh, bless&egrave;d shades!&nbsp; Oh, gentle,

&nbsp;&nbsp; From all the immoderate heat,<br />
In which the frantic world does burn and sweat!<br />
This does the lion-star, Ambition&rsquo;s rage;<br />
This Avarice, the dog-star&rsquo;s thirst assuage;<br />
Everywhere else their fatal power we see,<br />
They make and rule man&rsquo;s wretched destiny;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They neither set nor disappear,<br

Whilst we ne&rsquo;er feel their flame or influence here.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds that dance from bough to bough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sing above in every tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are not from fears and cares more free,<br />
Than we who lie, or sit, or walk below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And should by right be singers too.<br />
What prince&rsquo;s choir of music can excel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That which within this shade does dwell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which we nothing pay or give&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They, like all other poets, live<br />
Without reward or thanks for their obliging pains.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well if they become not prey.<br />
The whistling winds add their less artful strains,<br />
And a grave base the murmuring fountains play.<br />
Nature does all this harmony bestow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But to our plants, art&rsquo;s music too,<br />
The pipe, theorbo, and guitar we owe;<br />
The lute itself, which once was green and mute,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Orpheus struck the inspir&egrave;d lute,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The trees danced round, and understood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By sympathy the voice of wood.</p>

invite,<br />
And nothing does within resistance make;<br />

To the ear, the nose, the touch, the taste and sight?<br />
When Venus would her dear Ascanius keep<br />
A prisoner in the downy bands of sleep,<br />
She odorous herbs and flowers beneath him spread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the most soft and sweetest bed;<br />
Not her own lap would more have charmed his head.<br />
Who that has reason and his smell<br />
Would not among roses and jasmine dwell,<br />
Rather than all his spirits choke,<br />
With exhalations of dirt and smoke,<br />
And all the uncleanness which does drown<br />
In pestilential clouds a populous town?<br />
The earth itself breathes better perfumes here,<br />
Than all the female men or women there,<br />
Not without cause, about them bear.</p>

<p class="poetry">When Epicurus to the world had taught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That pleasure was the chiefest good,<br />
(And was perhaps i&rsquo; th&rsquo; right, if rightly
understood)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His life he to his doctrine brought,<br />
And in a garden&rsquo;s shade that sovereign pleasure sought.<br

Whoever a true epicure would be,<br />
May there find cheap and virtuous luxury.<br />
Vitellius his table, which did hold<br />
As many creatures as the Ark of old,<br />
That fiscal table, to which every day<br />
All countries did a constant tribute pay,<br />
Could nothing more delicious afford<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than Nature&rsquo;s liberality,<br />
Helped with a little art and industry,<br />
Allows the meanest gardener&rsquo;s board.<br />
The wanton taste no fish or fowl can choose<br />
For which the grape or melon she would lose,<br />
Though all the inhabitants of sea and air<br />
Be listed in the glutton&rsquo;s bill of fare;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet still the fruits of earth we see<br />
Placed the third storey high in all her luxury.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">VII.</p>
<p class="poetry">But with no sense the garden does comply,<br />
None courts or flatters, as it does the eye;<br />
When the great Hebrew king did almost strain<br />
The wondrous treasures of his wealth and brain<br />
His royal southern guest to entertain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though, she on silver floors did tread,<br />
With bright Assyrian carpets on them spread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To hide the metal&rsquo;s
poverty;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though she looked up to roofs of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nought around her could behold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But silk and rich embroidery,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Babylonian tapestry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wealthy Hiram&rsquo;s princely dye:<br />
Though Ophir&rsquo;s starry stones met everywhere her eye;<br />
Though she herself and her gay host were dressed<br />
With all the shining glories of the East;<br />
When lavish art her costly work had done;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The honour and the prize of bravery<br />
Was by the Garden from the Palace won;<br />
And every rose and lily there did stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Better attired by Nature&rsquo;s hand:<br />
The case thus judged against the king we see,<br />
By one that would not be so rich, though wiser far than he.</p>

<p class="poetry">Nor does this happy place only dispense<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such various pleasures to the sense:<br />

Its standing pleasure, and intrinsic wealth,<br />
The body&rsquo;s virtue, and the soul&rsquo;s good fortune,
health.<br />
The tree life, when it in Eden stood,<br />
Did its immortal head to heaven rear;<br />
It lasted a tall cedar till the flood;<br />
Now a small thorny shrub it does appear;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor will it thrive too everywhere:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It always here is freshest seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis only here an evergreen.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If through the strong and beauteous fence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of temperance and innocence,<br />
And wholesome labours and a quiet mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Any diseases passage find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They must not think here to assail<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A land unarm&egrave;d, or without a guard;<br />
They must fight for it, and dispute it hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before they can prevail.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarce any plant is growing here<br />
Which against death some weapon does not bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let cities boast that they provide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For life the ornaments of pride;<br />

In a more bright and sweet reflection shine?<br />
Where do we finer strokes and colours see<br />

Upon the third day&rsquo;s volume of the book?<br />
If we could open and intend our eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We all like Moses should espy<br />
Even in a bush the radiant Deity.<br />
But we despise these his inferior ways<br />
Though no less full of miracle and praise;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the flowers of heaven we gaze,<br />
The stars of earth no wonder in us raise,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The life of mankind sway.<br />
Although no part of mighty Nature be<br />
More stored with beauty, power, and mystery,<br />

To Nature, and but imitate her well:<br />
It over-rules, and is her master here.<br />
It imitates her Maker&rsquo;s power divine,<br />
And changes her sometimes, and sometimes does refine:<br />
It does, like grace, the fallen-tree restore<br />
To its blest state of Paradise before:<br />
Who would not joy to see his conquering hand<br />
O&rsquo;er all the vegetable world command,<br />
And the wild giants of the wood receive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What laws he&rsquo;s pleased to give?<br />
He bids the ill-natured crab produce<br />
The gentler apple&rsquo;s winy juice,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Galatea&rsquo;s purple kiss;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He does the savage hawthorn teach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bear the medlar and the pear;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He bids the rustic plum to rear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A noble trunk, and be a peach.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Daphne&rsquo;s coyness he does mock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And weds the cherry to her stock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though she refused Apollo&rsquo;s suit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even she, that chaste and virgin tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now wonders at herself to see<br />
That she&rsquo;s a mother made, and blushes in her fruit.</p>

With the ambassadors, who come in vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To entice him to a throne again.<br />
&ldquo;If I, my friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;should to you
show<br />

<h2><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>OF
GREATNESS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> we cannot attain to
greatness, says the Sieur de Montaigne, let us have our revenge
by railing at it; this he spoke but in jest.&nbsp; I believe he
desired it no more than I do, and had less reason, for he enjoyed
so plentiful and honourable a fortune in a most excellent
country, as allowed him all the real conveniences of it,
separated and purged from the incommodities.&nbsp; If I were but
in his condition, I should think it hard measure, without being
convinced of any crime, to be sequestered from it and made one of
the principal officers of state.&nbsp; But the reader may think
that what I now say is of small authority, because I never was,
nor ever shall be, put to the trial; I can therefore only make my
protestation.</p>
<p class="poetry">If ever I more riches did desire<br />
Than cleanliness and quiet do require;<br />
If e&rsquo;er ambition did my fancy cheat,<br />
With any wish so mean as to be great,<br />
Continue, Heaven, still from me to remove<br />
The humble blessings of that life I love.</p>
<p>I know very many men will despise, and some pity me, for this
humour, as a poor-spirited fellow; but I am content, and, like
Horace, thank God for being so.&nbsp; <i>Dii bene fecerunt inopis
me</i>, <i>quodque pusilli finxerunt animi</i>.&nbsp; I confess I
love littleness almost in all things.&nbsp; A little convenient
estate, a little cheerful house, a little company, and a very
little feast; and if I were ever to fall in love again (which is
a great passion, and therefore I hope I have done with it) it
would be, I think, with prettiness rather than with majestical
beauty.&nbsp; I would neither wish that my mistress, nor my
fortune, should be a bona roba, nor, as Homer used to describe
his beauties, like a daughter of great Jupiter, for the
stateliness and largeness of her person, but, as Lucretius says,
&ldquo;<i>Parvula</i>, <i>pumilio</i>,
&Chi;&alpha;&rho;&#8055;&tau;&omega;&nu; &mu;&#8055;&alpha;,
<i>tota merum sal</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where there is one man of this, I believe there are a thousand
of Senecio&rsquo;s mind, whose ridiculous affectation of grandeur
Seneca the elder describes to this effect.&nbsp; Senecio was a
man of a turbid and confused wit, who could not endure to speak
any but mighty words and sentences, till this humour grew at last
into so notorious a habit, or rather disease, as became the sport
of the whole town: he would have no servants but huge massy
fellows, no plate or household stuff but thrice as big as the
fashion; you may believe me, for I speak it without raillery, his
extravagancy came at last into such a madness that he would not
put on a pair of shoes each of which was not big enough for both
his feet; he would eat nothing but what was great, nor touch any
fruit but horse-plums and pound-pears.&nbsp; He kept a concubine
that was a very giantess, and made her walk, too, always in a
chiopins, till at last he got the surname of Senecio Grandio,
which, Messala said, was not his cognomen, but his
cognomentum.&nbsp; When he declaimed for the three hundred
Laced&aelig;monians, who also opposed Xerxes&rsquo; army of above
three hundred thousand, he stretched out his arms and stood on
tiptoes, that he might appear the taller, and cried out in a very
loud voice, &ldquo;I rejoice, I rejoice!&rdquo;&nbsp; We
wondered, I remember, what new great fortune had befallen his
eminence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Xerxes,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is all mine
own.&nbsp; He who took away the sight of the sea with the canvas
veils of so many ships . . . &rdquo; and then he goes on so, as I
know not what to make of the rest, whether it be the fault of the
edition, or the orator&rsquo;s own burly way of nonsense.</p>
<p>This is the character that Seneca gives of this hyperbolical
fop, whom we stand amazed at, and yet there are very few men who
are not, in some things, and to some degree, grandios.&nbsp; Is
anything more common than to see our ladies of quality wear such
high shoes as they cannot walk in without one to lead them? and a
gown as long again as their body, so that they cannot stir to the
next room without a page or two to hold it up?&nbsp; I may safely
say that all the ostentation of our grandees is just like a
train, of no use in the world, but horribly cumbersome and
incommodious.&nbsp; What is all this but spice of
<i>grandio</i>?&nbsp; How tedious would this be if we were always
bound to it?&nbsp; I do believe there is no king who would not
rather be deposed than endure every day of his reign all the
ceremonies of his coronation.&nbsp; The mightiest princes are
glad to fly often from these majestic pleasures (which is,
methinks, no small disparagement to them), as it were for refuge,
to the most contemptible divertisements and meanest recreations
of the vulgar, nay, even of children.&nbsp; One of the most
powerful and fortunate princes of the world of late, could find
out no delight so satisfactory as the keeping of little singing
birds, and hearing of them and whistling to them.&nbsp; What did
the emperors of the whole world?&nbsp; If ever any men had the
free and full enjoyment of all human greatness (nay, that would
not suffice, for they would be gods too) they certainly possessed
it; and yet one of them, who styled himself &ldquo;Lord and God
of the Earth,&rdquo; could not tell how to pass his whole day
pleasantly, without spending constant two or three hours in
catching of flies, and killing them with a bodkin, as if his
godship had been Beelzebub.&nbsp; One of his predecessors, Nero
(who never put any bounds, nor met with any stop to his
appetite), could divert himself with no pastime more agreeable
than to run about the streets all night in a disguise, and abuse
the women and affront the men whom he met, and sometimes to beat
them, and sometimes to be beaten by them.&nbsp; This was one of
his imperial nocturnal pleasures; his chiefest in the day was to
sing and play upon a fiddle, in the habit of a minstrel, upon the
public stage; he was prouder of the garlands that were given to
his divine voice (as they called it then) in those kind of
prizes, than all his forefathers were of their triumphs over
nations.&nbsp; He did not at his death complain that so mighty an
emperor, and the last of all the C&aelig;sarian race of deities,
should be brought to so shameful and miserable an end, but only
cried out, &ldquo;Alas! what pity it is that so excellent a
musician should perish in this manner!&rdquo;&nbsp; His uncle
Claudius spent half his time at playing at dice; that was the
main fruit of his sovereignty.&nbsp; I omit the madnesses of
Caligula&rsquo;s delights, and the execrable sordidness of those
of Tiberius.&nbsp; Would one think that Augustus himself, the
highest and most fortunate of mankind, a person endowed too with
many excellent parts of nature, should be so hard put to it
sometimes for want of recreations, as to be found playing at nuts
and bounding-stones with little Syrian and Moorish boys, whose
company he took delight in, for their prating and their
wantonness?</p>
<p class="poetry">Was it for this, that Rome&rsquo;s best blood
he spilt,<br />
With so much falsehood, so much guilt?<br />
Was it for this that his ambition strove<br />
To equal C&aelig;sar first, and after Jove?<br />
Greatness is barren sure of solid joys;<br />
Her merchandise, I fear, is all in toys;<br />
She could not else sure so uncivil be,<br />
To treat his universal majesty,<br />
His new created Deity,<br />
With nuts and bounding-stones and boys.</p>
<p>But we must excuse her for this meagre entertainment; she has
not really wherewithal to make such feasts as we imagine; her
guests must be contented sometimes with but slender cates, and
with the same cold meats served over and over again, even till
they become nauseous.&nbsp; When you have pared away all the
vanity, what solid and natural contentment does there remain
which may not be had with five hundred pounds a year? not so many
servants or horses, but a few good ones, which will do all the
business as well; not so many choice dishes at every meal; but at
several meals all of them, which makes them both the more healthy
and dine more pleasant; not so rich garments nor so frequent
changes, but as warm and as comely, and so frequent change, too,
as is every jot as good for the master, though not for the tailor
or valet-de-chambre; not such a stately palace, nor gilt rooms,
nor the costlier sorts of tapestry, but a convenient brick house,
with decent wainscot and pretty forest-work hangings.&nbsp;
Lastly (for I omit all other particulars, and will end with that
which I love most in both conditions), not whole woods cut in
walks, nor vast parks, nor fountain or cascade gardens, but herb
and flower and fruit gardens, which are more useful, and the
water every whit as clear and wholesome as if it darted from the
breasts of a marble nymph or the urn of a river-god.&nbsp; If for
all this you like better the substance of that former estate of
life, do but consider the inseparable accidents of both:
servitude, disquiet, danger, and most commonly guilt, inherent in
the one; in the other, liberty, tranquillity, security, and
innocence: and when you have thought upon this, you will confess
that to be a truth which appeared to you before but a ridiculous
paradox, that a low fortune is better guarded and attended than a
high one.&nbsp; If indeed, we look only upon the flourishing head
of the tree, it appears a most beautiful object.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;<i>Sed quantum vertice ad auras</i><br
/>
<i>&AElig;therias</i>, <i>tantum radice ad Tartara
tendit</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">As far up towards heaven the branches grow,<br
/>
So far the root sinks down to hell below.</p>
<p>Another horrible disgrace to greatness is, that it is for the
most part in pitiful want and distress.&nbsp; What a wonderful
thing is this, unless it degenerate into avarice, and so cease to
be greatness.&nbsp; It falls perpetually into such necessities as
drive it into all the meanest and most sordid ways of borrowing,
cozenage, and robbery, <i>Mancipiis locopules</i>, <i>eget aris
Cappadocum Rex</i>.&nbsp; This is the case of almost all great
men, as well as of the poor King of Cappadocia.&nbsp; They abound
with slaves, but are indigent of money.&nbsp; The ancient Roman
emperors, who had the riches of the whole world for their
revenue, had wherewithal to live, one would have thought, pretty
well at ease, and to have been exempt from the pressures of
extreme poverty.&nbsp; But yet with most of them it was much
otherwise, and they fell perpetually into such miserable penury,
that they were forced to devour or squeeze most of their friends
and servants, to cheat with infamous projects, to ransack and
pillage all their provinces.&nbsp; This fashion of imperial
grandeur is imitated by all inferior and subordinate sorts of it,
as if it were a point of honour.&nbsp; They must be cheated of a
third part of their estates, two other thirds they must expend in
vanity, so that they remain debtors for all the necessary
provisions of life, and have no way to satisfy those debts but
out of the succours and supplies of rapine; &ldquo;as riches
increase,&rdquo; says Solomon, &ldquo;so do the mouths that
devour it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The master mouth has no more than before;
the owner, methinks, is like Genus in the fable, who is
perpetually winding a rope of hay and an ass at the end
perpetually eating it.&nbsp; Out of these inconveniences arises
naturally one more, which is, that no greatness can be satisfied
or contented with itself: still, if it could mount up a little
higher, it would be happy; if it could but gain that point, it
would obtain all its desires; but yet at last, when it is got up
to the very top of the peak of Teneriffe, it is in very great
danger of breaking its neck downwards, but in no possibility of
ascending upwards into the seat of tranquillity above the
moon.&nbsp; The first ambitious men in the world, the old giants,
are said to have made an heroical attempt of scaling Heaven in
despite of the gods, and they cast Ossa upon Olympus and Pelion
upon Ossa, two or three mountains more they thought would have
done their business, but the thunder spoiled all the work when
they were come up to the third storey;</p>
<p class="poetry">And what a noble plot was crossed,<br />
And what a brave design was lost.</p>
<p>A famous person of their offspring, the late giant of our
nation, when, from the condition of a very inconsiderable
captain, he had made himself lieutenant-general of an army of
little Titans, which was his first mountain; and afterwards
general, which was his second; and after that absolute tyrant of
three kingdoms, which was the third, and almost touched the
heaven which he affected; is believed to have died with grief and
discontent because he could not attain to the honest name of a
king, and the old formality of a crown, though he had before
exceeded the power by a wicked usurpation.&nbsp; If he could have
compassed that, he would perhaps have wanted something else that
is necessary to felicity, and pined away for the want of the
title of an emperor or a god.&nbsp; The reason of this is, that
greatness has no reality in nature, but is a creature of the
fancy&mdash;a notion that consists only in relation and
comparison.&nbsp; It is indeed an idol; but St. Paul teaches us
that an idol is nothing in the world.&nbsp; There is in truth no
rising or meridian of the sun, but only in respect to several
places: there is no right or left, no upper hand in nature;
everything is little and everything is great according as it is
diversely compared.&nbsp; There may be perhaps some villages in
Scotland or Ireland where I might be a great man; and in that
case I should be like C&aelig;sar&mdash;you would wonder how
C&aelig;sar and I should be like one another in
anything&mdash;and choose rather to be the first man of the
village than second at Rome.&nbsp; Our Country is called Great
Britain, in regard only of a lesser of the same name; it would be
but a ridiculous epithet for it when we consider it together with
the kingdom of China.&nbsp; That, too, is but a pitiful rood of
ground in comparison of the whole earth besides; and this whole
globe of earth, which we account so immense a body, is but one
point or atom in relation to those numberless worlds that are
scattered up and down in the infinite space of the sky which we
behold.&nbsp; The other many inconveniences of grandeur I have
spoken of dispersedly in several chapters, and shall end this
with an ode of Horace, not exactly copied but rudely
imitated.</p>

<h2><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>OF
AVARICE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are two sorts of avarice; the
one is but of a bastard kind; and that is, the rapacious appetite
of gain, not for its own sake, but for the pleasure of refunding
it immediately through all the channels of pride and
luxury.&nbsp; The other is the true kind, and properly so called;
which is a restless and unsatiable desire of riches, not for any
further end of use, but only to hoard, and preserve, and
perpetually increase them.&nbsp; The covetous man of the first
kind is like a greedy ostrich, which devours any metal, but it is
with an intent to feed upon it, and in effect it makes a shift to
digest and excern it.&nbsp; The second is like the foolish
chough, which loves to steal money only to hide it.&nbsp; The
first does much harm to mankind, and a little good too, to some
few.&nbsp; The second does good to none; no, not to
himself.&nbsp; The first can make no excuse to God, or angels, or
rational men for his actions.&nbsp; The second can give no reason
or colour, not to the devil himself, for what he does: he is a
slave to Mammon without wages.&nbsp; The first makes a shift to
be beloved; aye, and envied, too, by some people.&nbsp; The
second is the universal object of hatred and contempt.&nbsp;
There is no vice has been so pelted with good sentences, and
especially by the poets, who have pursued it with stories and
fables, and allegories and allusions; and moved, as we say, every
stone to fling at it, among all which, I do not remember a more
fine and gentlemen-like correction than that which was given it
by one line of Ovid&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Desunt luxuri&aelig; malta</i>,
<i>avariti&aelig; omnia</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">Much is wanting to luxury; all to avarice</p>
<p>To which saying I have a mind to add one member and render it
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Poverty wants some, luxury many, avarice all
things.</p>
<p>Somebody says of a virtuous and wise man, that having nothing,
he has all.&nbsp; This is just his antipode, who, having all
things, yet has nothing.&nbsp; He is a guardian eunuch to his
beloved gold: <i>Audivi eos amatores esse maximos sed nil
potesse</i>.&nbsp; They are the fondest lovers, but impotent to
enjoy.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, oh, what man&rsquo;s condition can be
worse<br />
Than his, whom plenty starves, and blessings curse?<br />
The beggars but a common fate deplore,<br />
The rich poor man&rsquo;s emphatically poor.</p>
<p>I wonder how it comes to pass that there has never been any
law made against him.&nbsp; Against him, do I say?&nbsp; I mean
for him, as there is a public provision made for all other
madmen.&nbsp; It is very reasonable that the king should appoint
some persons (and I think the courtiers would not be against this
proposition) to manage his estate during his life (for his heirs
commonly need not that care), and out of it to make it their
business to see that he should not want alimony befitting his
condition, which he could never get out of his own cruel
fingers.&nbsp; We relieve idle vagrants and counterfeit beggars,
but have no care at all of these really poor men, who are,
methinks, to be respectfully treated in regard of their
quality.&nbsp; I might be endless against them, but I am almost
choked with the superabundance of the matter.&nbsp; Too much
plenty impoverishes me as it does them.&nbsp; I will conclude
this odious subject with part of Horace&rsquo;s first Satire,
which take in his own familiar style:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">I admire, M&aelig;cenas, how it comes to
pass,<br />
That no man ever yet contented was,<br />
Nor is, nor perhaps will be, with that state<br />
In which his own choice plants him, or his fate.<br />
Happy the merchant! the old soldier cries.<br />
The merchant, beaten with tempestuous skies<br />
Happy the soldier! one half-hour to thee<br />
Gives speedy death or glorious victory.<br />
The lawyer, knocked up early from his rest<br />
By restless clients, calls the peasant blest.<br />
The peasant, when his labours ill succeed,<br />
Envies the mouth which only talk does feed.<br />
&rsquo;Tis not, I think you&rsquo;ll say, that I want store<br />
Of instances, if here I add no more,<br />
They are enough to reach at least a mile<br />
Beyond long Orator Fabius his style.<br />
But hold, you whom no fortune e&rsquo;er endears,<br />
Gentlemen, malcontents, and mutineers,<br />
Who bounteous Jove so often cruel call,<br />
Behold, Jove&rsquo;s now resolved to please you all.<br />
Thou, soldier, be a merchant; merchant, thou<br />
A soldier be; and lawyer to the plough.<br />
Change all your stations straight.&nbsp; Why do they stay?<br />
The devil a man will change now when he may.<br />
Were I in General Jove&rsquo;s abus&egrave;d case,<br />
By Jove, I&rsquo;d cudgel this rebellious race;<br />
But he&rsquo;s too good; be all, then, as you were;<br />
However, make the best of what you are,<br />
And in that state be cheerful and rejoice,<br />
Which either was your fate or was your choice.<br />
No; they must labour yet, and sweat and toil,<br />
And very miserable be awhile.<br />
But &rsquo;tis with a design only to gain<br />
What may their age with plenteous ease maintain;<br />
The prudent pismire does this lesson teach,<br />
And industry to lazy mankind preach.<br />
The little drudge does trot about and sweat,<br />
Nor does he straight devour all he can get,<br />
But in his temperate mouth carries it home,<br />
A stock for winter which he knows must come.<br />
And when the rolling world to creatures here<br />
Turns up the deformed wrong side of the year,<br />
And shuts him in with storms and cold and wet,<br />
He cheerfully does his past labours eat.<br />
Oh, does he so? your wise example, the ant<br />
Does not at all times rest, and plenty want.<br />
But, weighing justly a mortal ant&rsquo;s condition,<br />
Divides his life &rsquo;twixt labour and fruition.<br />
Thee neither heat, nor storms, nor wet, nor cold<br />
From thy unnatural diligence can withhold,<br />
To the Indies thou wouldst run rather than see<br />
Another, though a friend, richer than thee.<br />
Fond man! what good or beauty can be found<br />
In heaps of treasure buried under ground?<br />
Which, rather than diminished e&rsquo;er to see,<br />
Thou wouldst thyself, too, buried with them be<br />
And what&rsquo;s the difference is&rsquo;t not quite as bad<br />
Never to use, as never to have had?<br />
In thy vast barns millions of quarters store,<br />
Thy belly, for all that, will hold no more<br />
Than mine does.&nbsp; Every baker makes much bread,<br />
What then?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s with no more than others fed.<br />
Do you within the bounds of Nature live,<br />
And to augment your own you need not strive;<br />
One hundred acres will no less for you<br />
Your life&rsquo;s whole business than ten thousand do.<br />
But pleasant &rsquo;tis to take from a great store;<br />
What, man? though you&rsquo;re resolved to take no more<br />
Than I do from a small one; if your will<br />
Be but a pitcher or a pot to fill,<br />
To some great river for it must you go,<br />
When a clear spring just at your feet does flow?<br />
Give me the spring which does to human use,<br />
Safe, easy, and untroubled stores produce;<br />
He who scorns these, and needs will drink at Nile,<br />
Must run the danger of the crocodile;<br />
And of the rapid stream itself which may,<br />
At unawares bear him perhaps away.<br />
In a full flood Tantalus stands, his skin<br />
Washed o&rsquo;er in vain, for ever dry within;<br />
He catches at the stream with greedy lips,<br />
From his touched mouth the wanton torment slips.<br />
You laugh now, and expand your careful brow:<br />
&rsquo;Tis finely said, but what&rsquo;s all this to you?<br />
Change but the name, this fable is thy story,<br />
Thou in a flood of useless wealth dost glory,<br />
Which thou canst only touch, but never taste;<br />
The abundance still, and still the want does last.<br />
The treasures of the gods thou wouldst not spare,<br />
But when they&rsquo;re made thine own, they sacred are,<br />
And must be kept with reverence; as if thou<br />
No other use of precious gold didst know<br />
But that of curious pictures to delight<br />
With the fair stamp thy virtuoso sight.<br />
The only true and genuine use is this,<br />
To buy the things which nature cannot miss<br />
Without discomfort, oil, and vital bread.<br />
And wine by which the life of life is fed,<br />
And all those few things else by which we live<br />
All that remains is given for thee to give.<br />
If cares and troubles, envy, grief, and fear,<br />
The bitter fruits be which fair riches bear,<br />
If a new poverty grow out of store,<br />
The old plain way, ye gods! let me be poor.</p>

<h2><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>THE
DANGERS OF AN HONEST MAN IN MUCH COMPANY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> twenty thousand naked Americans
were not able to resist the assaults of but twenty well-armed
Spaniards, I see little possibility for one honest man to defend
himself against twenty thousand knaves, who are all furnished
<i>cap-&agrave;-pie</i> with the defensive arms of worldly
prudence, and the offensive, too, of craft and malice.&nbsp; He
will find no less odds than this against him if he have much to
do in human affairs.&nbsp; The only advice, therefore, which I
can give him is, to be sure not to venture his person any longer
in the open campaign, to retreat and entrench himself, to stop up
all avenues, and draw up all bridges against so numerous an
enemy.&nbsp; The truth of it is, that a man in much business must
either make himself a knave, or else the world will make him a
fool: and if the injury went no farther than the being laughed
at, a wise man would content himself with the revenge of
retaliation: but the case is much worse, for these civil
cannibals too, as well as the wild ones, not only dance about
such a taken stranger, but at last devour him.&nbsp; A sober man
cannot get too soon out of drunken company; though they be never
so kind and merry among themselves, it is not unpleasant only,
but dangerous to him.&nbsp; Do ye wonder that a virtuous man
should love to be alone?&nbsp; It is hard for him to be
otherwise; he is so, when he is among ten thousand; neither is
the solitude so uncomfortable to be alone without any other
creature, as it is to be alone in the midst of wild beasts.&nbsp;
Man is to man all kind of beasts&mdash;a fawning dog, a roaring
lion, a thieving fox, a robbing wolf, a dissembling crocodile, a
treacherous decoy, and a rapacious vulture.&nbsp; The civilest,
methinks, of all nations, are those whom we account the most
barbarous; there is some moderation and good nature in the
Toupinambaltians who eat no men but their enemies, whilst we
learned and polite and Christian Europeans, like so many pikes
and sharks, prey upon everything that we can swallow.&nbsp; It is
the great boast of eloquence and philosophy, that they first
congregated men dispersed, united them into societies, and built
up the houses and the walls of cities.&nbsp; I wish they could
unravel all they had woven; that we might have our woods and our
innocence again instead of our castles and our policies.&nbsp;
They have assembled many thousands of scattered people into one
body: it is true, they have done so, they have brought them
together into cities to cozen, and into armies to murder one
another; they found them hunters and fishers of wild creatures,
they have made them hunters and fishers of their brethren; they
boast to have reduced them to a state of peace, when the truth is
they have only taught them an art of war; they have framed, I
must confess, wholesome laws for the restraint of vice, but they
raised first that devil which now they conjure and cannot bind;
though there were before no punishments for wickedness, yet there
was less committed because there were no rewards for it.&nbsp;
But the men who praise philosophy from this topic are much
deceived; let oratory answer for itself, the tinkling, perhaps,
of that may unite a swarm: it never was the work of philosophy to
assemble multitudes, but to regulate only, and govern them when
they were assembled, to make the best of an evil, and bring them,
as much as is possible, to unity again.&nbsp; Avarice and
ambition only were the first builders of towns, and founders of
empire; they said, &ldquo;Go to, let us build us a city and a
tower whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name,
lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; What was the beginning of Rome, the
metropolis of all the world? what was it but a concourse of
thieves, and a sanctuary of criminals? it was justly named by the
augury of no less than twelve vultures, and the founder cemented
his walls with the blood of his brother.</p>
<p>Not unlike to this was the beginning even of the first town,
too, in the world, and such is the original sin of most cities:
their actual increase daily with their age and growth; the more
people, the more wicked all of them.&nbsp; Every one brings in
his part to inflame the contagion, which becomes at last so
universal and so strong, that no precepts can be sufficient
preservatives, nor anything secure our safety, but flight from
among the infected.&nbsp; We ought, in the choice of a situation,
to regard above all things the healthfulness of the place, and
the healthfulness of it for the mind rather than for the
body.&nbsp; But suppose (which is hardly to be supposed) we had
antidote enough against this poison; nay, suppose, further, we
were always and at all places armed and provided both against the
assaults of hostility and the mines of treachery, it will yet be
but an uncomfortable life to be ever in alarms; though we were
compassed round with fire to defend ourselves from wild beasts,
the lodging would be unpleasant, because we must always be
obliged to watch that fire, and to fear no less the defects of
our guard than the diligences of our enemy.&nbsp; The sum of this
is, that a virtuous man is in danger to be trod upon and
destroyed in the crowd of his contraries; nay, which is worse, to
be changed and corrupted by them, and that it is impossible to
escape both these inconveniences without so much caution as will
take away the whole quiet, that is, the happiness of his
life.&nbsp; Ye see, then, what he may lose; but, I pray, what can
he get there?&nbsp; <i>Quid Rom&aelig; faciam</i>?&nbsp;
<i>Mentiri nescio</i>.&nbsp; What should a man of truth and
honesty do at Rome? he can neither understand, nor speak the
language of the place; a naked man may swim in the sea, but it is
not the way to catch fish there; they are likelier to devour him
than he them, if he bring no nets and use no deceits.&nbsp; I
think, therefore, it was wise and friendly advice which Martial
gave to Fabian when he met him newly arrived at Rome.</p>
<p class="poetry">Honest and poor, faithful in word and
thought;<br />
What has thee, Fabian, to the city brought?<br />
Thou neither the buffoon nor bawd canst play,<br />
Nor with false whispers the innocent betray:<br />
Nor corrupt wives, nor from rich beldams get<br />
A living by thy industry and sweat:<br />
Nor with vain promises and projects cheat,<br />
Nor bribe or flatter any of the great.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re a man of learning, prudent,
just:<br />
A man of courage, firm, and fit for trust.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why, you may stay, and live unenvied here;<br />
But, &rsquo;faith! go back, and keep you where you were.</p>
<p>Nay, if nothing of all this were in the case, yet the very
sight of uncleanness is loathsome to the cleanly; the sight of
folly and impiety vexatious to the wise and pious.</p>
<p>Lucretius, by his favour, though a good poet, was but an
ill-natured man, when he said, &ldquo;It was delightful to see
other men in a great storm.&rdquo;&nbsp; And no less ill-natured
should I think Democritus, who laughed at all the world, but that
he retired himself so much out of it that we may perceive he took
no great pleasure in that kind of mirth.&nbsp; I have been drawn
twice or thrice by company to go to Bedlam, and have seen others
very much delighted with the fantastical extravagancy of so many
various madnesses, which upon me wrought so contrary an effect,
that I always returned not only melancholy, but even sick with
the sight.&nbsp; My compassion there was perhaps too tender, for
I meet a thousand madmen abroad, without any perturbation,
though, to weigh the matter justly, the total loss of reason is
less deplorable than the total depravation of it.&nbsp; An exact
judge of human blessings, of riches, honours, beauty, even of wit
itself, should pity the abuse of them more than the want.</p>
<p>Briefly, though a wise man could pass never so securely
through the great roads of human life, yet he will meet
perpetually with so many objects and occasions of compassion,
grief, shame, anger, hatred, indignation, and all passions but
envy (for he will find nothing to deserve that) that he had
better strike into some private path; nay, go so far, if he
could, out of the common way, <i>ut nec facta audiat
Pelopidarum</i>; that he might not so much as hear of the actions
of the sons of Adam.&nbsp; But, whither shall we fly, then? into
the deserts, like the ancient hermits?</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Qua terra patet fera regnat Erynnis</i>.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In facinus jurasse
putes</i>.</p>
<p>One would think that all mankind had bound themselves by an
oath to do all the wickedness they can; that they had all, as the
Scripture speaks, sold themselves to sin: the difference only is,
that some are a little more crafty (and but a little, God knows)
in making of the bargain.&nbsp; I thought, when I went first to
dwell in the country, that without doubt I should have met there
with the simplicity of the old poetical golden age: I thought to
have found no inhabitants there, but such as the shepherds of Sir
Philip Sidney in Arcadia, or of Monsieur d&rsquo;Urf&eacute; upon
the banks of Lignon; and began to consider with myself, which way
I might recommend no less to posterity the happiness and
innocence of the men of Chertsey: but to confess the truth, I
perceived quickly, by infallible demonstrations, that I was still
in old England, and not in Arcadia, or La Forrest; that if I
could not content myself with anything less than exact fidelity
in human conversation, I had almost as good go back and seek for
it in the Court, or the Exchange, or Westminster Hall.&nbsp; I
ask again, then, whither shall we fly, or what shall we do?&nbsp;
The world may so come in a man&rsquo;s way that he cannot choose
but salute it; he must take heed, though, not to go a whoring
after it.&nbsp; If by any lawful vocation or just necessity men
happen to be married to it, I can only give them St. Paul&rsquo;s
advice: &ldquo;Brethren, the time is short; it remains that they
that have wives be as though they had none.&nbsp; But I would
that all men were even as I myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all cases they must be sure that they do <i>mundum
ducere</i>, and not <i>mundo nubere</i>.&nbsp; They must retain
the superiority and headship over it: happy are they who can get
out of the sight of this deceitful beauty, that they may not be
led so much as into temptation; who have not only quitted the
metropolis, but can abstain from ever seeing the next market town
of their country.</p>
<h3>CLAUDIAN&rsquo;S OLD MAN OF VERONA.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Happy</span> the man who
his whole time doth bound<br />
Within the enclosure of his little ground.<br />
Happy the man whom the same humble place<br />
(The hereditary cottage of his race)<br />
From his first rising infancy has known,<br />
And by degrees sees gently bending down,<br />
With natural propension to that earth<br />
Which both preserved his life, and gave him birth.<br />
Him no false distant lights by fortune set,<br />
Could ever into foolish wanderings get.<br />
He never dangers either saw, or feared,<br />
The dreadful storms at sea he never heard.<br />
He never heard the shrill alarms of war,<br />
Or the worse noises of the lawyers&rsquo; bar.<br />
No change of consuls marks to him the year,<br />
The change of seasons is his calendar.<br />
The cold and heat winter and summer shows,<br />
Autumn by fruits, and spring by flowers he knows.<br />
He measures time by landmarks, and has found<br />
For the whole day the dial of his ground.<br />
A neighbouring wood born with himself he sees,<br />
And loves his old contemporary trees.<br />
Has only heard of near Verona&rsquo;s name,<br />
And knows it, like the Indies, but by fame.<br />
Does with a like concernment notice take<br />
Of the Red Sea, and of Benacus lake.<br />
Thus health and strength he to a third age enjoys,<br />
And sees a long posterity of boys.<br />
About the spacious world let other roam,<br />
The voyage Life is longest made at home.</p>
<h2><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>THE
SHORTNESS OF LIFE AND UNCERTAINTY OF RICHES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you should see a man who were to
cross from Dover to Calais, run about very busy and solicitous,
and trouble himself many weeks before in making provisions for
the voyage, would you commend him for a cautious and discreet
person, or laugh at him for a timorous and impertinent
coxcomb?&nbsp; A man who is excessive in his pains and diligence,
and who consumes the greatest part of his time in furnishing the
remainder with all conveniences and even superfluities, is to
angels and wise men no less ridiculous; he does as little
consider the shortness of his passage that he might proportion
his cares accordingly.&nbsp; It is, alas, so narrow a strait
betwixt the womb and the grave, that it might be called the
<i>Pas de Vie</i>, as well as the <i>Pas de Calais</i>.&nbsp; We
are all
&#7952;&phi;&#8053;&mu;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&omicron;&iota; as
<i>Pindar</i> calls us, creatures of a day, and therefore our
Saviour bounds our desires to that little space; as if it were
very probable that every day should be our last, we are taught to
demand even bread for no longer a time.&nbsp; The sun ought not
to set upon our covetousness; no more than upon our anger; but as
to God Almighty a thousand years are as one day, so, in direct
opposition, one day to the covetous man is as a thousand years,
<i>tam brevi fortis jaculatur &aelig;vo multa</i>, so far he
shoots beyond his butt.&nbsp; One would think he were of the
opinion of the <i>Millenaries</i>, and hoped for so long a reign
upon earth.&nbsp; The patriarchs before the flood, who enjoyed
almost such a life, made, we are sure, less stores for the
maintaining of it; they who lived nine hundred years scarcely
provided for a few days; we who live but a few days, provide at
least for nine hundred years.&nbsp; What a strange alteration is
this of human life and manners! and yet we see an imitation of it
in every man&rsquo;s particular experience, for we begin not the
cares of life till it be half spent, and still increase them as
that decreases.&nbsp; What is there among the actions of beasts
so illogical and repugnant to reason?&nbsp; When they do anything
which seems to proceed from that which we call reason, we disdain
to allow them that perfection, and attribute it only to a natural
instinct.&nbsp; If we could but learn to number our days (as we
are taught to pray that we might) we should adjust much better
our other accounts, but whilst we never consider an end of them,
it is no wonder if our cares for them be without end too.&nbsp;
Horace advises very wisely, and in excellent good words,
<i>spatio brevi spem longam reseces</i>; from a short life cut
off all hopes that grow too long.&nbsp; They must be pruned away
like suckers that choke the mother-plant, and hinder it from
bearing fruit.&nbsp; And in another place to the same sense,
<i>Vit&aelig; summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare longam</i>,
which Seneca does not mend when he says, <i>Oh quanta dementia
est spes longas inchoantium</i>! but he gives an example there of
an acquaintance of his named Senecio, who from a very mean
beginning by great industry in turning about of money through all
ways of gain, had attained to extraordinary riches, but died on a
sudden after having supped merrily, <i>In ipso actu ben&eacute;
cedentium rerum</i>, <i>in ipso procurrentis fortun&aelig;
impetu</i>; in the full course of his good fortune, when she had
a high tide and a stiff gale and all her sails on; upon which
occasion he cries, out of Virgil:</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>Insere nunc Melib&aelig;e pyros</i>, <i>pone
ordine vites</i>:</p>
<p class="poetry">Go to, Melib&aelig;us, now,<br />
Go graff thy orchards and thy vineyards plant;<br />
Behold the fruit!</p>
<p>For this Senecio I have no compassion, because he was taken,
as we say, in <i>ipso facto</i>, still labouring in the work of
avarice; but the poor rich man in St. Luke (whose case was not
like this) I could pity, methinks, if the Scripture would permit
me, for he seems to have been satisfied at last; he confesses he
had enough for many years; he bids his soul take its ease; and
yet for all that, God says to him, &ldquo;Thou fool, this night
thy soul shall be required of thee, and the things thou hast laid
up, whom shall they belong to?&rdquo;&nbsp; Where shall we find
the causes of this bitter reproach and terrible judgment; we may
find, I think, two, and God perhaps saw more.&nbsp; First, that
he did not intend true rest to the soul, but only to change the
employments of it from avarice to luxury; his design is to eat
and to drink, and to be merry.&nbsp; Secondly, that he went on
too long before he thought of resting; the fulness of his old
barns had not sufficed him, he would stay till he was forced to
build new ones, and God meted out to him in the same measure;
since he would have more riches than his life could contain, God
destroyed his life and gave the fruits of it to another.</p>
<p>Thus God takes away sometimes the man from his riches, and no
less frequently riches from the man: what hope can there be of
such a marriage where both parties are so fickle and uncertain;
by what bonds can such a couple be kept long together?</p>

<h2><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>THE
DANGER OF PROCRASTINATION.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A letter to Mr</i>. <i>S</i>.
<i>L.</i></p>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> glad that you approve and
applaud my design of withdrawing myself from all tumult and
business of the world and consecrating the little rest of my time
to those studies to which nature had so motherly inclined me, and
from which fortune like a step-mother has so long detained
me.&nbsp; But nevertheless, you say&mdash;which But is
&aelig;rugo mera, a rust which spoils the good metal it grows
upon.&nbsp; But, you say, you would advise me not to precipitate
that resolution, but to stay a while longer with patience and
complaisance, till I had gotten such an estate as might afford
me, according to the saying of that person whom you and I love
very much, and would believe as soon as another man, <i>cum
dignitate otium</i>.&nbsp; This were excellent advice to Joshua,
who could bid the sun stay too.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no
fooling with life when it is once turned beyond forty.&nbsp; The
seeking for a fortune then is but a desperate after game, it is a
hundred to one if a man fling two sixes and recover all;
especially if his hand be no luckier than mine.&nbsp; There is
some help for all the defects of fortune, for if a man cannot
attain to the length of his wishes, he may have his remedy by
cutting of them shorter.&nbsp; Epicurus writes a letter to
Idomeneus, who was then a very powerful, wealthy, and it seems
bountiful person, to recommend to him, who had made so many men
rich, one Pythocles, a friend of his, whom he desired to be made
a rich man too: But I entreat you that you would not do it just
the same way as you have done to many less deserving persons, but
in the most gentlemanly manner of obliging him, which is not to
add anything to his estate, but to take something from his
desires.&nbsp; The sum of this is, that for the uncertain hopes
of some conveniences we ought not to defer the execution of a
work that is necessary, especially when the use of those things
which we would stay for may otherwise be supplied, but the loss
of time never recovered.&nbsp; Nay, further yet, though we were
sure to obtain all that we had a mind to, though we were sure of
getting never so much by continuing the game, yet when the light
of life is so near going out, and ought to be so precious, <i>Le
jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle</i>, the play is not worth the
expense of the candle.&nbsp; After having been long tossed in a
tempest, if our masts be standing, and we have still sail and
tackling enough to carry us to our port, it is no matter for the
want of streamers and topgallants; <i>utere velis totes pande
sinus</i>.&nbsp; A gentleman in our late civil wars, when his
quarters were beaten up by the enemy, was taken prisoner and lost
his life afterwards, only by staying to put on a band and adjust
his periwig.&nbsp; He would escape like a person of quality, or
not at all, and died the noble martyr of ceremony and
gentility.&nbsp; I think your counsel of <i>festina lente</i> is
as ill to a man who is flying from the world, as it would have
been to that unfortunate well-bred gentleman, who was so cautious
as not to fly undecently from his enemies, and therefore I prefer
Horace&rsquo;s advice before yours.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<i>Sapere
ande</i>; <i>incipe</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Begin: the getting out of doors is the greatest part of the
journey.&nbsp; Varro teaches us that Latin proverb, <i>Portam
itineri longissimam esse</i>.&nbsp; But to return to Horace,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<i>Sapere
aude</i>;<br />
<i>Incipe</i>.&nbsp; <i>Virendi qui recte prorogat horam</i><br
/>
<i>Rusticus expectat dum labitur amnis</i>; <i>at ille</i><br />
<i>Labitur</i>, <i>et labetur is omne volubilis
&aelig;vum</i>.</p>
<p>Begin, be bold, and venture to be wise;<br />
He who defers the work from day to day,<br />
Does on a river&rsquo;s bank expecting stay,<br />
Till the whole stream which stopped him should be gone,<br />
That runs, and as it runs, for ever will run on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>C&aelig;sar (the man of expedition above all others) was so
far from this folly, that whensoever in a journey he was to cross
any river, he never went one foot out of his way for a bridge, or
a ford, or a ferry; but flung himself into it immediately, and
swam over; and this is the course we ought to imitate if we meet
with any stops in our way to happiness.&nbsp; Stay till the
waters are low, stay till some boats come by to transport you,
stay till a bridge be built for you; you had even as good stay
till the river be quite past.&nbsp; Persius (who, you used to
say, you do not know whether he be a good poet or no, because you
cannot understand him, and whom, therefore, I say, I know to be
not a good poet) has an odd expression of these procrastinations,
which, methinks, is full of fancy.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Jam cras hesterum consumpsimus</i>, <i>ecce
aliud cras egerit hos annos</i>.</p>
<p>Our yesterday&rsquo;s to-morrow now is gone,<br />
And still a new to-morrow does come on;<br />
We by to-morrows draw up all our store,<br />
Till the exhausted well can yield no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now, I think, I am even with you, for your <i>otium cum
dignitate</i> and <i>festina lente</i>, and three or four other
more of your new Latin sentences: if I should draw upon you all
my forces out of Seneca and Plutarch upon this subject, I should
overwhelm you, but I leave those as <i>triarii</i> for your next
charges.&nbsp; I shall only give you now a light skirmish out of
an epigrammatist, your special good friend, and so,
<i>vale</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>OF
MYSELF.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a hard and nice subject for a
man to write of himself; it grates his own heart to say anything
of disparagement and the reader&rsquo;s ears to hear anything of
praise for him.&nbsp; There is no danger from me of offending him
in this kind; neither my mind, nor my body, nor my fortune allow
me any materials for that vanity.&nbsp; It is sufficient for my
own contentment that they have preserved me from being
scandalous, or remarkable on the defective side.&nbsp; But
besides that, I shall here speak of myself only in relation to
the subject of these precedent discourses, and shall be likelier
thereby to fall into the contempt than rise up to the estimation
of most people.&nbsp; As far as my memory can return back into my
past life, before I knew or was capable of guessing what the
world, or glories, or business of it were, the natural affections
of my soul gave me a secret bent of aversion from them, as some
plants are said to turn away from others, by an antipathy
imperceptible to themselves and inscrutable to man&rsquo;s
understanding.&nbsp; Even when I was a very young boy at school,
instead of running about on holidays and playing with my fellows,
I was wont to steal from them and walk into the fields, either
alone with a book, or with some one companion, if I could find
any of the same temper.&nbsp; I was then, too, so much an enemy
to all constraint, that my masters could never prevail on me, by
any persuasions or encouragements, to learn without book the
common rules of grammar, in which they dispensed with me alone,
because they found I made a shift to do the usual exercises out
of my own reading and observation.&nbsp; That I was then of the
same mind as I am now (which I confess I wonder at myself) may
appear by the latter end of an ode which I made when I was but
thirteen years old, and which was then printed with many other
verses.&nbsp; The beginning of it is boyish, but of this part
which I here set down, if a very little were corrected, I should
hardly now be much ashamed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">IX.</p>
<p class="poetry">This only grant me, that my means may lie<br />
Too low for envy, for contempt too high.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some honour I would have,<br />
Not from great deeds, but good alone.<br />
The unknown are better than ill known.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumour can ope the grave;<br />
Acquaintance I would have, but when it depends<br />
Not on the number, but the choice of friends.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">X.</p>
<p class="poetry">Books should, not business, entertain the
light,<br />
And sleep, as undisturbed as death, the night.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My house a cottage, more<br />
Than palace, and should fitting be<br />
For all my use, no luxury.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My garden painted o&rsquo;er<br />
With Nature&rsquo;s hand, not Art&rsquo;s; and pleasures
yield,<br />
Horace might envy in his Sabine field.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">XI.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus would I double my life&rsquo;s fading
space,<br />
For he that runs it well twice runs his race.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in this true delight,<br />
These unbought sports, this happy state,<br />
I would not fear, nor wish my fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But boldly say each night,<br />
To-morrow let my sun his beams display<br />
Or in clouds hide them&mdash;I have lived to-day.</p>
<p>You may see by it I was even then acquainted with the poets
(for the conclusion is taken out of Horace), and perhaps it was
the immature and immoderate love of them which stamped first, or
rather engraved, these characters in me.&nbsp; They were like
letters cut into the bark of a young tree, which with the tree
still grow proportionably.&nbsp; But how this love came to be
produced in me so early is a hard question.&nbsp; I believe I can
tell the particular little chance that filled my head first with
such chimes of verse as have never since left ringing
there.&nbsp; For I remember when I begun to read and to take some
pleasure in it, there was wont to lie in my mother&rsquo;s
parlour.&nbsp; (I know not by what accident, for she herself
never in her life read any book but of devotion), but there was
wont to lie Spenser&rsquo;s works; this I happened to fall upon,
and was infinitely delighted with the stories of the knights, and
giants, and monsters, and brave houses, which I found everywhere
there (though my understanding had little to do with all this);
and by degrees with the tinkling of the rhyme and dance of the
numbers, so that I think I had read him all over before I was
twelve years old, and was thus made a poet as immediately as a
child is made an eunuch.&nbsp; With these affections of mind, and
my heart wholly set upon letters, I went to the university, but
was soon torn from thence by that violent public storm which
would suffer nothing to stand where it did, but rooted up every
plant, even from the princely cedars to me, the hyssop.&nbsp; Yet
I had as good fortune as could have befallen me in such a
tempest; for I was cast by it into the family of one of the best
persons, and into the court of one of the best princesses of the
world.&nbsp; Now though I was here engaged in ways most contrary
to the original design of my life, that is, into much company,
and no small business, and into a daily sight of greatness, both
militant and triumphant, for that was the state then of the
English and French Courts; yet all this was so far from altering
my opinion, that it only added the confirmation of reason to that
which was before but natural inclination.&nbsp; I saw plainly all
the paint of that kind of life, the nearer I came to it; and that
beauty which I did not fall in love with when, for aught I knew,
it was real, was not like to bewitch or entice me when I saw that
it was adulterate.&nbsp; I met with several great persons, whom I
liked very well, but could not perceive that any part of their
greatness was to be liked or desired, no more than I would be
glad or content to be in a storm, though I saw many ships which
rid safely and bravely in it.&nbsp; A storm would not agree with
my stomach, if it did with my courage.&nbsp; Though I was in a
crowd of as good company as could be found anywhere, though I was
in business of great and honourable trust, though I ate at the
best table, and enjoyed the best conveniences for present
subsistence that ought to be desired by a man of my condition in
banishment and public distresses, yet I could not abstain from
renewing my old schoolboy&rsquo;s wish in a copy of verses to the
same effect.</p>
<p class="poetry">Well then; I now do plainly see,<br />
This busy world and I shall ne&rsquo;er agree, etc.</p>
<p>And I never then proposed to myself another advantage from His
Majesty&rsquo;s happy restoration, but the getting into some
moderately convenient retreat in the country, which I thought in
that case I might easily have compassed, as well as some others,
with no greater probabilities or pretences have arrived to
extraordinary fortunes.&nbsp; But I had before written a shrewd
prophecy against myself, and I think Apollo inspired me in the
truth, though not in the elegance of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thou, neither great at court nor in the war,<br />
Nor at th&rsquo; exchange shalt be, nor at the wrangling bar;<br
/>
Content thyself with the small barren praise,<br />
Which neglected verse does raise, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, by the failing of the forces which I had expected, I
did not quit the design which I had resolved on; I cast myself
into it <i>A corps perdu</i>, without making capitulations or
taking counsel of fortune.&nbsp; But God laughs at a man who says
to his soul, &ldquo;Take thy ease&rdquo;: I met presently not
only with many little encumbrances and impediments, but with so
much sickness (a new misfortune to me) as would have spoiled the
happiness of an emperor as well as mine.&nbsp; Yet I do neither
repent nor alter my course.&nbsp; <i>Non ego perfidum dixi
sacramentum</i>.&nbsp; Nothing shall separate me from a mistress
which I have loved so long, and have now at last married, though
she neither has brought me a rich portion, nor lived yet so
quietly with me as I hoped from her.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;<i>Nec vos</i>, <i>dulcissima
mundi</i><br />
<i>Nomina</i>, <i>vos Mus&aelig;</i>, <i>libertas</i>,
<i>otia</i>, <i>libri</i>,<br />
<i>Hortique sylvesque anima remanente relinquam</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor by me e&rsquo;er shall
you,<br />
You of all names the sweetest, and the best,<br />
You Muses, books, and liberty, and rest;<br />
You gardens, fields, and woods forsaken be,<br />
As long as life itself forsakes not me.</p>
<p>But this is a very petty ejaculation.&nbsp; Because I have
concluded all the other chapters with a copy of verses, I will
maintain the humour to the last.</p>

Instead of art and luxury in food,<br />
Let mirth and freedom make thy table good.<br />
If any cares into thy daytime creep,<br />
At night, without wines, opium, let them sleep.<br />
Let rest, which Nature does to darkness wed,<br />

Devours the vital substance of the lord.<br />
The land itself does there the feast bestow,<br />

Three or four suits one winter here does waste,<br />
One suit does there three or four winters last.<br />
Here every frugal man must oft be cold,<br />

<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Translation</i>.]</p>
<p class="poetry">O <span class="smcap">wayfarer</span>, beneath
his household shrine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Cowley lies, closed in a little den;<br />
A life too empty and his lot combine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To give him rest from all the toils of men.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not shining with unseemly shows of want,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor noble with the indolence of ease;<br />
Fearless of spirit as a combatant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With mob-loved wealth and all its devotees.</p>
<p>That you may fairly speak of him as dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold how little earth contents him now!<br />
Pray, wayfarer, that all his cares be fled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that the earth lie lightly on his brow.</p>
<p>Strew flowers here, strew roses soon to perish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the dead life joys in all flowers that blow;<br
/>
Crown with sweet herbs, bank blossoms high, to cherish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s ashes that are yet aglow.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
